66-127 DC Grand Challenge First-Year Seminar: Environmental Justice,"Fall: 9 units Wondering what the ""Green New Deal"" proposal is about? Does it seem like you have to choose between protecting people and protecting the planet? How does environmentalism connect to struggles over social justice and human rights? This first-year interdisciplinary seminar is an introduction to the Grand Challenge: Environmental Justice. In Giovanna de Chiro's words, the environmental justice movement is working ""toward building diverse, dynamic, and powerful coalitions to address the world's most pressing social and environmental crises global poverty and global climate change by organizing across scales and 'seeking a global vision' for healthy, resilient, and sustainable communities."" In this seminar, we'll study the history and science behind two interconnected challenges for environmental justice: global climate change and fine-particulate air pollution. Both types of pollution start with combustion of fossil fuels. Particulate air pollution kills roughly 7 million globally each year; these air pollution deaths happen close to the source, with unequal levels of exposure and risk for people according to class and race. Climate change, mostly from carbon dioxide and methane emissions, is spread globally and lasts well beyond our lifetimes, yet the effects are again disproportionately based on class and race. In this course, we'll explore the science, history, ethics, and public perception of these problems, with implications for Pittsburgh and the planet, and for the near- and long-term future.",http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/schools-colleges/dietrichcollegeofhumanitiesandsocialsciences/courses/,2.5,Combustion,engineering_capabilities-2,"{""combustion"": 1}"

66-236 Introduction to Environmental Ideas,"Fall and Spring: 9 units By recognizing that environmental problems are themselves complex and require insights from social, political, and scientific perspectives, the interdisciplinary Program in Environmental and Sustainability Studies (ESS) prepares students to gain proficiency in different disciplinary habits of thinking. As part of this endeavor, students take part in informed discussions about interpretive lenses; ways of seeing; and thinking about social, cultural, and historical contexts for interpretations of environment and sustainability. This seminar-style course introduces key methods and approaches for interdisciplinary inquiry within a framework of Environmental Humanities and Environmental Justice. Scholar Giovanna de Chiro writes: ""The term 'environmental justice' emerged from the activism of communities of color in the United States in the latter half of the twentieth century...They advocate for social policies that uphold the right to meaningful, democratic participation of frontline communities in environmental decision making."" The implications of disciplinary narratives and approaches to questions of environment and sustainability, and the implications for social justice, are a key and repeated question in the course. The role of poverty as a cultural, political, and historical phenomenon is a motif in many of our discussions. We'll explore contrasting historical, cultural, and disciplinary explanations for hunger, famine, and food insecurity. Further, we'll explore how so-called ""environmental"" explanations for food scarcity, which rationalize the persistence of hunger and poverty in the 21st century, have distracted from decades of expertise, reminding us that hunger and poverty are social problems. In contrast to these so-called ""environmental"" explanations, there is no scarcity of food in the present era.

"48-686 Systems, Cybernetics, Conversation","Spring: 12 units Across many design disciplinesarchitecture and computational design, media and interaction design, design of services and organizationsmethods for grappling with complex adaptive systems is now table stakes. Furthermore, design today demands profound, authentic attention to equity, human and non-human living systems, climate and environment, sustainability and ethics. Overall, designers must have skills to collaborate in cross-disciplinary teams. An encompassing framework for these disparate disciplines and domains of 21st-century design is the transdisciplinarity (or ""antidisciplinarity"") of Cybernetics. Cybernetics can be understood as the study of ""systems with purpose"", whether machines or living things, including their unpredictable interactions. Central to Cybernetics is conversation as a mechanism of design, inclusivity, participation, innovation, and the impetus to action. The course offers systems frameworks and models of conversation that are also relevant to Designing for the Internet of Things (48-675), Inquiry into Computation Design (48-727), and Design Studies: Systems ( 51-277 ).

As we enter an age where companies like Uber are testing driverless cars in Pittsburgh and innovative interfaces like IBMs Watson can play jeopardy and learn techniques for medical diagnoses, how are we to negotiate an intelligence explosion that for many individuals might threaten the very notions of what it means to be human? The future of human-to-machine relationships will likely define our historical epoch and yet, many young technologists and humanists underestimate the downstream impact of technological innovations on human society. Presently, we have little choice but to attend to this rapidly anxiety-ridden question. This seminar will attend to the challenge of present existential questions on what it means to be human (read not machine) in the context of a rapidly advancing technological age. We will consider human narratives throughout history that exam how governments and individual citizens defined humanity in the context of slavery and colonialism as a framework for exploring and projecting what it means to be human in the age of rapidly advancing intelligent machines. We will trace the technological advancements of the recent five decades and identify historical precedents and speculative narratives that help us to consider issues like labor, economic disparity, negotiations of power, human dignity and ethical responsibility within the context of human relations with advancing technological tools that are now coined, artificial intelligence.",http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/schools-colleges/schoolofcomputerscience/addlmajorsminors/courses/,2.0,Explosion,technical_skills-1,"{""explosion"": 2}"

79-208 Witchcraft and Witch-Hunting,"Intermittent: 9 units Between the late 15th and the early 18th centuries, many Europeans became convinced that their society was threatened by a conspiracy of diabolic witches. Although Western beliefs in witchcraft and ""devil worship"" dated back to antiquity, the 16th and 17th centuries witnessed the most intense campaign of witch-hunting in all of Europe's history. Before it was over, the ""Great European Witch-Hunt"" of the early modern era cost the lives of thousands across Europe and in its colonies. And although the witch-hunts in early modern Europe and its colonies gradually came to an end, beliefs in witchcraft persist into the modern era and, in many parts of the world today, continue to generate campaigns of popular violence against alleged perpetrators. This course examines witchcraft beliefs and witch-hunting in historical perspective in both their European and colonial contexts. In addition to the early modern witch-hunts, it will address modern witchcraft beliefs and consider witch-hunting as a global problem today. It will focus on the origin and rationale of witch beliefs, the factors driving the timing and intensity of witch-hunts, and the patterns of accusations. Throughout, we will examine the many historical and regional variations in witch beliefs and prosecutions and explore how they reflect major social and cultural issues such as the relationship between ""popular"" and ""elite"" culture; religious change; state formation; gender and patriarchy; and the rationalization of law, medicine, and science.

Fossil-fueled industrialization, chemical engineering, and resource-intensive consumerism have generated immense wealth, but they have also left long-term, cumulative legacies of toxic pollution and ecological harm. While these legacies affect everyone, their impacts are by no means evenly distributed. In this course, we will use the tools of anthropology, political ecology, and history to examine experiences of toxic exposure in different parts of the world, including Pittsburgh. Our analyses will ask how inequalities of race, class, gender, and ability shape exposure as well as how cultural differences create divergent understandings of ecology, health, and their interrelationship. We will consider, moreover, how these disparities shape what people know about pollution and whether/how they demand accountability for it.

09-111 Nanolegos: Chemical Building Blocks,"Fall: 9 units How does chemistry provide the foundation and building blocks in science, engineering, and technology? How does activity on the particle and molecular level that we cannot see cause things to happen and function on a level we CAN observe? What basic chemical concepts are needed as tools to understand current significant research and technology, as well as to understand phenomena and problems in the world around us? This course will emphasize answering these questions by presenting ""problem- or context-first"", then applicable chemical concepts on an as-needed basis. It is structured around phenomena relevant to modern society, research, and technology rather than the conceptual tools (i.e. systems- or application-, rather than content-driven). Many of the conceptual tools (e.g. structure, interaction between energy and matter, interparticle forces, reaction stoichiometry, thermodynamics and kinetics) are used throughout the course, to help reinforce these ideas and promote an integrated understanding. The major contexts and phenomena that we will explore in applying and connecting chemical concepts are: (1) sustainable energy, (2) charge motion in materials, (3) natural versus engineered catalysts, (4) polymeric materials, and (5) reversible reactions in environmental and biological chemistry",http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/schools-colleges/melloncollegeofscience/departmentofchemistry/courses/,3.5,Catalyst,production-3,"{""catalyst"": 1}"
