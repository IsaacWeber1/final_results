ARTV 20037. Generous Gravities. 100 Units.,"Generous Gravities is a comparative study of two distinct cultural experiences in the production, influence and imposition of cultural power and how artistic production has been influenced in response. The production of a culture is a messy, promiscuous affair. Rather than a conception of culture as a singular set of values, built up from a singular core, what we call the culture of a place is a result of an endless process of accrual, rejection, imposition and influence. Specifically, the class will focus on the city of Paris both as case study and antecedent of our conception of the cosmopolitan in the 19th and 20th century along with the Republic of Georgia's historical experience in the 20th and early 21st century. These two places give us sites to think through ideas of renewal and exchange between radically different ideological and aesthetic systems and the complex cultures produced as a result of centuries long processes. In the 19th century, Paris was the origin point for a set of specific cultural currents that combined to make something new, perverse and alive - what we today call The Cosmopolitan - before their subsequent fraying at the end of the twentieth century. Today as it was in the past, the Republic of Georgia stands at an intersection of some of the most important forces of the early 21st century while at the same time in the midst of a creative explosion within its cultural economy.",http://collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/thecollege/visualarts/,1.5,Explosion,technical_skills-1,"{""explosion"": 1}"

ARTV 22322. Sensing the Anthropocene. 100 Units.,"In this co-taught course between the departments of English (Jennifer Scappettone) and Visual Arts (Amber Ginsburg), we will deploy those senses most overlooked in academic discourse surrounding aesthetics and urbanism--hearing, taste, touch, and smell--to explore the history and actuality of Chicago as a site of anthropogenic changes. Holding the bulk of our classes out of doors, we will move through the city seeking out and documenting traces of the city's foundations in phenomena such as the filling in of swamp; the river as pipeline; and the creation of transportation and industrial infrastructure--all with uneven effects on human and nonhuman inhabitants. Coursework will combine readings in history and theory of the Anthropocene together with examples of how artists and activists have made the Anthropocene visible, tangible, and audible, providing forums for playful documentation and annotations as we draw, score, map, narrate, sing, curate and collate our sensory experience of the Anthropocene into a final experimental book project. Admission is by consent only: please write a short paragraph briefly sketching your academic background and naming your interest in the course.

ARTV 22501. Art & Machine Intelligence. 100 Units.,"Artists have long used autonomous processes to aid in the creation of their work. From 18th century parlor games to contemporary visual culture, creators have applied stochastic methods, automation, and simulation to generate music, text, and imagery. In the last five years, as machine learning has matured into broadly applicable artificial intelligence, artists have turned towards neural networks as a new frontier for creative practice. This studio course will explore the history and uses of autonomous creative tools and focus, more specifically, on leading edge artistic applications of AI. Students will receive exposure to a breadth of methods in this domain and produce multiple projects engaged with these topics. Software development experience is not required, though it may be useful.",http://collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/thecollege/visualarts/,1.5,Automation,technical_skills-1,"{""automation"": 1}"
MADD 11005. Problems in the Study of Gender and Sexuality: Media Wars. 100 Units.,"In our contemporary moment, we have become accustomed to terms such as 'counter-terrorism' that signal an effort to resist internal and external threats, and those suggesting that we live in an age of 'post-truth' dominated by 'corporate-media,' 'fake news,' and 'fact-challenged' journalism. Taking this platform as our starting place, this class explores how these terms and their use have been gendered; have situated both gender and sexuality as either weapons of resistance or objects of destruction. This class will be historically organized insofar as we will begin our discussion with ways that media - broadly conceived to include cinema, print and visual-cultural forms, television, and the internet - have aimed to 'counter' patriarchal, heteronormative, and hegemonic systems of representation of gender and sexuality.",http://collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/thecollege/MediaArtsandDesign/,3.5,CCUS,production-3,"{""ccus"": 1}"
GLST 20150. Sustainable Urban Development. 100 Units.,"The course covers concepts and methods of sustainable urbanism, livable cities, resiliency, and smart growth principles from a social, environmental and economic perspective. In this course we examine how the development in and of cities - in the US and around the world - can be sustainable, especially given predictions of a future characterized by increasing environmental and social volatility. We begin by critiquing definitions of sustainability. The fundamental orientation of the course will be understanding cities as complex socio-natural systems, and so we will look at approaches to sustainability grouped around several of the most important component systems: climate, energy, transportation, and water. With the understanding that sustainability has no meaning if it excludes human life, perspectives from both the social sciences and humanities are woven throughout: stewardship and environmental ethics are as important as technological solutions and policy measures.",http://collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/thecollege/globalstudies/,5.5,Sustainability,sustainability_and_policy-4,"{""sustainability"": 3}"
MADD 20600. AI + Art: artificial.horse. 100 Units.,"Saddle up and ride into the untamed territories of human-AI co-creation. Much like how horses have been our trusty companions in transportation and labor, AI has become a powerful tool for us to navigate the computational era. This course presents a studio environment for performative and avant guarde approaches to experimenting with the newest interfaces and advancements in generative AI, like ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion, while examining predecessors like chatbots and early forms of automation. Technology is not simply an external tool that we use, it shapes our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Giddy up, as we playfully experiment with the creative, quirky, and unquantifiable human elements in AI-making media art projects as AI, for AI, and with AI. A diversity of artistic and technical backgrounds are welcome.",http://collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/thecollege/MediaArtsandDesign/,1.5,Automation,technical_skills-1,"{""automation"": 1}"
MADD 22800. 3D Modeling and Sculpting for Video Games. 100 Units.,"In this class, students will learn how to create high resolution 3D model concepts for the production of video games. High resolution sculpting is an integral part of today's 3D production pipelines. This course aims to focus on this stage of the production pipeline, and its role in creating high quality games. While this class will focus on creating assets for video games, digital sculpting skills can be applied to a variety of other industries, such as architecture, fashion and jewelry, to name a few.",http://collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/thecollege/MediaArtsandDesign/,4.0,Pipeline,delivery_and_storage-3,"{""pipeline"": 2}"
GLST 26382. Development and Environment in Latin America. 100 Units.,"Description: This course will consider the relationship between development and the environment in Latin America and the Caribbean. We will consider the social, political, and economic effects of natural resource extraction, the quest to improve places and peoples, and attendant ecological transformations, from the onset of European colonialism in the fifteenth century, to state- and private-led improvement policies in the twentieth. Some questions we will consider are: How have policies affected the sustainability of land use in the last five centuries? In what ways has the modern impetus for development, beginning in the nineteenth century and reaching its current intensity in the mid-twentieth, shifted ideas and practices of sustainability in both environmental and social terms? And, more broadly, to what extent does the notion of development help us explain the historical relationship between humans and the environment?",http://collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/thecollege/globalstudies/,5.0,Sustainability,sustainability_and_policy-4,"{""sustainability"": 2}"

MADD 27908. American Graphic Art and Commercial Culture: 1850-1960. 100 Units.,"This class focuses on widely distributed printed images, most of them with commercial, aesthetic, and/or political significance, along with the graphic design traditions and typography associated with them. While concentrating on American imagery, the context would be international, reflecting the condition of popular graphic arts in this country. Among other things it would treat book illustration, posters, advertising art, magazines and newspapers, cartooning, postcards, children's literature, commercial paper, and trade catalogs. Necessarily, given this wide scope, it will be episodic in character, but it will also attempt to relate this visual explosion to larger artistic movements, major events, technological changes, and political trends. It would also explore, from time to time, the roles played by collecting, exhibition, and academic commentary in legitimating the subject, as well as the power of ethnic and racial stereotyping and the multiplication of trade and printing journals. The aim, in short, is to examine the flowering of a visual print culture that had its roots in the Gutenberg Revolution of the 15th century. There will be both class discussion and lecturing. This is art in context, emphasizing breadth and the introduction of figures, institutions, and movements nurtured by an expansive production and distribution network. The course will be hosted by the Special Collections Research Center at Regenstein Library.",http://collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/thecollege/MediaArtsandDesign/,1.5,Explosion,technical_skills-1,"{""explosion"": 1}"
