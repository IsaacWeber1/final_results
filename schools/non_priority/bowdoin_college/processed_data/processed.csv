What does this teach us about French culture and society? What is the relation between literary prizes and the promotion of French culture more broadly? In the context of globalization, what political statement is being made? What is exactly the type of culture, themes, and discourse promoted via this literature given the new makeup of the French population? Immigration has considerably changed the face of France.
