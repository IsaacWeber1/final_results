SPAN-UA 307 Narrar lo precario (4 Credits),"""In Spanish. En el contexto de creciente desigualdad social y de nuevas formas de lucha política, la noción de “precariedad indica un núcleo de la imaginación cultural de las últimas décadas en América Latina. Reflexiones culturales sobre el trabajo, violencia de género y racial, migración y deterioro ambiental parecen articularse alrededor de una pregnancia de la “vida precaria” como terreno sobre el que tienen lugar muchas de nuestras experiencias, nuestras sensibilidades y nuestras luchas colectivas. Esta centralidad de lo precario, sin embargo, nos enfrenta a un desafío nuevo: ¿cómo narrar una condición precaria que desarma toda idea estable de progreso, de continuidad y de futuro? ¿Qué pasa con los poderes y las posibilidades de la narración allí donde la imaginación del futuro (individual, social, planetario) aparece bajo el signo del riesgo, de la indeterminación, de la inseguridad? ¿Cómo se narra allí donde la supervivencia misma está en juego? El presente curso quiere investigar estas preguntas a partir de una serie de materiales culturales producidos en América Latina en las últimas tres décadas. Trabajando materiales literarios y cinematográficos junto a discusiones teóricas e intervenciones desde el activismo, el curso quiere explorar las formas de narración, las retóricas de futuridad, la centralidad de la vulnerabilidad corporal y los modos de alianza colectiva que se juegan alrededor de la condición precaria que parece caracterizar nuestra época. Entre los materiales de análisis y discusión se encuentran textos de Samantha Schweblin, Roberto Bolaño, Selva Almada, Diego Zúñiga, y editoriales cartoneras, junto a films de Patricio Guzman, Eduardo Coutinho, Naomi Klein y Laura Citarella.

EAST-UA 526 Chinese Cultural Revolution in the Global Context (4 Credits),"""China’s “Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution” (GPCR/CR, 1966-1976) was one of the most important political and cultural events of the twentieth century. For various reasons, including the highly-contested nature of the decade and the difficulty of pursuing serious scholarship on the issue in the PRC, studies of the CR have, until very recently, remained partial and highly polemical. Nevertheless, there has been an explosion of new work on the topic in recent years, the most intriguing of which seeks to rethink the CR in heretofore unexplored ways. Intended for students who have at least some background in modern Chinese history, cultural studies, literature and/or film, this course will exploit and engage with these new ways of thinking about this hugely consequential period. Through careful reading, discussion, and research, this class will explore different dimensions of the CR: what did it mean to those who participated at the time of their participation? What did it mean in its aftermath? Why and how did such a utopian movement devolve into its opposite? How can we think about the CR today and what should our ethical considerations be in doing so? Students will be asked to check their prejudices at the door, to come in with fresh minds and fresh ideas, so as to explore how such a monumental movement could have taken hold in China for a decade. We will not start with any pre-judgements about the CR, its politics, its meaning, or its afterlives.

FYSEM-UA 503 In Search of Lost Time (4 Credits),"We will read Proust (in translation) as he should be read: hedonistically—with respect and admiration but also with delectation. A prodigious novel of more than 4,000 pages, In Search of Lost Time is one of modern literature’s most challenging and deeply pleasurable reads. The richest of the themes it explores is desire—its remembrance, transformation, perversion, defeat, and final resurgence in the form of art. Often said to be the first modern fiction, In Search of Lost Time is still unparalleled in how it combines finesse and wit with raw emotion, self-examination with social history, profound psychological acuity with a dazzling portrait of the French beau monde at the outset of modernity, how it merges an audacious explosion of literary form with explorations of memory, attachment, deception, lust, jealousy, ambition, and disappointment. Although Marcel Proust (1871–1922) is often cited as France’s greatest novelist (and the novelist’s novelist), his prose is so layered and brilliant that, unfortunately, many readers begin at the beginning and never move past the first fifty pages, reading the same gorgeous sentences again and again. But while In Search of Lost Time’s prose style may have been its most radical contribution to the art of fiction, its vast, thrilling architecture cannot be understood until it has been read once in its entirety. In this intensive class, we will move at a brisk pace through the work, merely glancing at its riches on our way, until we arrive at the uniquely euphoric experience of reading the final volume, when we begin to understand the extraordinarily intimate relationship Proust creates with his reader. In-class creative writing exercises are designed to help with the reading and to expand an expressive, personal response.

FYSEM-UA 649 America In The World: Benevolent Giant or Just Another Superpower? (4 Credits),"From the moment of its birth, the United States has told a story about itself: that it was not simply a nation among nations but a beacon of democracy and individual freedom. As it became a world power at the end of the 19th century, the US began to deploy its wealth and force abroad to advance its national interests, as other great powers did—but also, or so it said and so its people deeply believed, to shape a more peaceful, democratic, and just world order. The United States continued to pursue that self-assigned mission through two world wars and the Cold War, and now in the face of terrorism. America is unlike any previous world power both in the beliefs on which it was founded and in its geographical situation, surrounded by oceans and far removed from the conflicts in which it intervenes. And yet it is also a hegemon—a dominant power—and shapes the world to its perceived interests, as all hegemons do. Over the last century, critics have never stopped accusing the US of hypocritically pursuing narrow interests in the name of global good. In electing a new president, American voters may finally have put that claim to rest by choosing someone who does not accept the nation's historic mission. This class will examine a series of critical points—war, colonialism, the founding of global institutions, interventions abroad—in order to understand the tension between America's idealistic global mission and the brute fact of its power and dominance.",https://bulletins.nyu.edu/undergraduate/arts-science/courses/fysem-ua/,3.5,CCUS,production-3,"{""ccus"": 1}"
FYSEM-UA 691 Narrating Climate Change (4 Credits),"Global warming is, by many accounts, the gravest danger facing human life on the planet at the present moment. Unlike other potentially catastrophic crises, however, climate change lacks clear divisions between people or nations or apocalyptic symbols. Climate change does not split the globe into a Free World and an Evil Empire, or a sacred Motherland and a nation of Capitalist Running Dogs. As the author Per Espen Stoknes writes, “There is no clear enemy with climate change. We’re all participating in the climate crisis—if there is an enemy, it’s us. And it’s hard to go to war against ourselves.” The transformations associated with climate change do not appear as sudden explosions or even exist as perceptible on a daily fashion; instead, they exist as graphs that climb ever upward, as never before heard of glacial shelves cracking, and droughts, fires, and storms “correlated to but not caused by” disruptions in climatic patterns. Its changes are long term, it poses collective action problems, and its agents are generalized and often indistinct. Climate change, in short, poses narrative problems. This seminar will examine six separate, but interrelated, disciplinary means of narrating climate change―scientific writing, historical narratives, journalism, political explanations, personal memoir, and fiction. The emphasis will be not, primarily, on what narratives “work” but on investigation of the commonalities and differences in which climate change is explained and put in time according to different fields and disciplines. Students will explore the differing ways that disciplines attempt to convey knowledge, learn how to recognize and understand different narrative forms, and determine for themselves what makes for effective narration.",https://bulletins.nyu.edu/undergraduate/arts-science/courses/fysem-ua/,1.5,Explosion,technical_skills-1,"{""explosion"": 1}"

FYSEM-UA 751 Reading Religion in the Anthropocene: Religious Ecology and Environmental Ethics (4 Credits),"What does the dawning of the Anthropocene—a new geological era in which humans determine the fate of the planet—mean for our common identity? If nothing else, its realization has pointed to a new discontent with civilization and the terrifying possibility of social collapse. Some scholars and activists have pointed to foundational texts of world religions as the root causes of our current ecological crisis. Still others have cited these very traditions as resources for societal and personal renewal in the face of global climate change. We probe the limits of ecological awareness, intergenerational responsibility, and animal welfare in a range of religious traditions and texts including the Hebrew Bible, the Gospels, the Vedas, the Bhagavad Gita, the Tripitaka, and the Babylonian Talmud. Through critical analysis of these texts, with an eye toward the nonhuman, we investigate both the accusations against and the promise of these traditions. We assess whether religious texts themselves can ever be the cause of real social and political change, or whether they only “come alive” when read and acted upon. Along the way we explore various discourses in the environmental humanities and consider their efficacy in understanding ancient religious traditions.",https://bulletins.nyu.edu/undergraduate/arts-science/courses/fysem-ua/,3.5,CCUS,production-3,"{""ccus"": 1}"

In this seminar, we use an interdisciplinary approach and explore how landscapes have been constructed or influenced by both cultural and natural processes. We will review the main theoretical perspectives and a wide range of methods used in landscape archaeology that can be applied to other disciplines as well. We particularly focus on technological applications including satellite remote sensing, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), geospatial analysis, methods in field survey, and archaeological site prospection.

While chemistry is often seen as a science involving matter on a small scale (such as atoms and molecules) and technology is typically thought of on larger scales, materials chemistry bridges these extremes and typically deals with matter in the micron size range (100 times smaller than the width of human hair!). This field uses advancements from chemistry, engineering, physics, and other disciplines and applies them to the real world. Breakthroughs in materials science readily become implemented in technology and influence how humans interact with each other and the world around them. In this seminar, we will explore different types of materials developed over the span of human history (during the Stone and Bronze Ages, the Industrial Revolution, modernity, etc.). We will investigate how the development of these materials then inspired the fabrication of tools and technology across different time periods.

CAMS-UA 149 Play & Creativity (4 Credits),"How do we conceptualize the elusive phenomenon of “play”? Is there a biological imperative to play? How does play influence child development and maintain psychological health as we mature? In this course we survey the historical, scientific, clinical, cultural, and artistic perspectives on the role of play through the life cycle. Is the play-element a catalyst for creativity and innovation? We explore various theories of creativity through the lens of neuroscience, psychology, philosophy, and mysticism. We consider the use of improvisation and free play in life, art, clinical work, and scientific discovery. Topics include: exploration of play styles, observations of animal play, the role of play in child development and education, how play influences attachment and social bonding, the aesthetics and cultural value of play, the consequences of play deprivation, the art and science of creativity, and the relationship between creativity, mental illness, and genius.",https://bulletins.nyu.edu/undergraduate/arts-science/courses/cams-ua/,3.5,Catalyst,production-3,"{""catalyst"": 1}"

ARTH-UA 9676 Recycling Architecture: New Life for Older Bldgs (4 Credits),"Re-cycling or re-using buildings is one of the most important subjects in the built environment. It is an area in which there have been some remarkable successes in recent years both in America and in Europe: impressive and much loved public buildings have been given new life by progressive architects and developers, helping ensure that our towns and cities retain their individual character. Unlike international modern buildings, historic buildings are strong markers of the industry, aspirations, local materials and the resources of a particular place. Recycling old buildings is crucial so our architectural and social history can be read in the townscape that surrounds us.A course about recycling old buildings presents an opportunity to explore some basic themes in the built environment – architecture history, environmental issues and the rise of the conservation movement in the 19th and 20th centuries. Buildings are responsible for 50% of our carbon emissions each year, and more than half of a building’s energy footprint is expended in the relatively short spell of its construction. ‘Even the best planned new buildings are no match against the preservation, modernization, conversion and re-use of existing buildings when it comes down to the consumption of resources’ (Karl Ganser) Re-using our redundant historic architecture for new purposes has obvious positive benefits for the planet. Equally, upgrading historic buildings in use, like our housing stock, is environmentally smarter that demolishing parts of our cities and starting again with new structures.The locations and nature of industrial production has changed across the world. Most western cities have a surfeit of industrial spaces and buildings lying empty, often in their centres. This course will first cover the story of the development of industrial architecture from the 18th century onwards and look at how these robust, proud and often highly decorative structures can accommodate new uses. We will look at how inventive designers, backed by local government, have found ways of reclaiming the industrial ‘brownfield’ landscapes into new spaces for recreation and development in our cities, focusing on particular examples in New York, London and in Germany.",https://bulletins.nyu.edu/undergraduate/arts-science/courses/arth-ua/,4.5,Carbon Emissions,sustainability_and_policy-4,"{""carbon emissions"": 1}"
