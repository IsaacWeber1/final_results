However, at Brown, students are empowered to attain these goals by becoming \"the architects of their own education.\" But what does that mean and how do you do it? This class will address these questions by considering Brown's open curriculum in the context of American collegiate education and by providing students with the tools to clarify and articulate their educational goals and direction as an outgrowth of their values, interests, and life plans.",

Our goal is to develop a deeper understanding of the methods by reading the original papers and placing them in the context of what was occurring in the field at the time. Although our focus is on the development of methods in the field of epidemiology, what constitutes an “epidemiologic method” has become less clear as the lines dividing fields have blurred.

    "description": "This course explores the ethics of global public health engagement. Global health implementation is fraught with ethical conundrums. These ethical conundrums include the process of generating rigorous evidence, championing health as a human right, engaging global partners in meaningful collaborations, and implementing complex programs in low-resource settings. These ethical challenges are driven by North-South inequities and by differences in socioeconomic backgrounds, culture, language, and other intersectional identities. This course introduces scholars to global health ethics as a framework for tackling health disparities, grappling in a scholarly and practical way with the complex fabric of global health research, policy, and practice.",

Likewise firms are supposed to police their supply chains, decarbonize their operations, raise their wages, and pay more taxes, all at once. These areas constitute ‘hard problems’ for two main reasons. Economically, we don’t really have much of a clue about how to do many of these things. Politically, there are powerful interests and entrenched ideas out there that want to keep things just as they are.",

It examines the practice and profession of diplomacy and its relationship to the policy process. While the practice of diplomacy and the policy-making process has a U.S. focus, the lessons learned apply to other nation states as well. We briefly review the history of inter-state relations, including the international legal basis for diplomatic relations. Diplomacy has evolved over the years and has been greatly influenced by modern technology; however, it continues to incorporate such common functions as policy formulation, representation, reporting, negotiation, intercultural contacts and interaction with the media, parliamentary bodies and other external actors. The course will provide a knowledge base for understanding the policy process and will expose students to policy analysis, memo writing for decisionmaking, negotiations and verbal communications.",

In this junior seminar, we will examine the economic and political, and ideological factors that have contributed to this historical moment, learn about how Americans experience living in an unequal society, and consider the future of equality and social mobility in the United States.

Through an on-the-ground and ethnographic engagement with displaced communities worldwide, we interrogate analytical distinctions between legal and illegal categories of asylum seekers and migrants, internally displaced and refugees. Rather than treating refugeehood as an immanent crisis, we examine how the language of crisis shapes migration in the era of global capitalism.

We’re also in a crisis of truth. It’s impossible to think about what is happening in politics without thinking about how it’s covered. This course will explore that connection—in a practice-oriented, writing intensive approach which will aim to transform your understanding both of what’s really happening in politics and how those developments are presented to the public.

U.S. public policies based on these theories were deployed both domestically and abroad. The seminar will argue that these two sets of policies—at home and abroad--often draw from similar ideas about hierarchies and categories of human beings; land-use, relations among humans, other living beings, and inanimate earth features; work and livelihoods; gender, race, capacity for self-definition and political self-representation, who should wield power, and so on.",

Colonial power was constantly debated, resisted, and subverted across metropole and colonies. We pay close attention to these voices and trace the emergence of political anti-colonialism in the aftermath of the First World War. We will examine how French colonialism was fought and eventually (partially) dismantled towards the middle of the 20th century.

It has fundamentally reshaped the environment, social landscapes, lives, and economies, and its impact will only increase as the global vehicle population doubles, as predicted, to two billion by the year 2030. This class will explore the immense social, political, health, and environmental consequences, as well as cultural and political economic explanations for the car population explosion. Alternative forms and futures for transit will be considered throughout the course.",

What does the pattern of gender inequality in social life (how bodies are classified and made unequal, what kinds of bodies command political power, what kinds of work people do and how well they are compensated for their labors, the punishments they receive when they violate the law, etc.) have to do with the way states govern?

    "description": "Aging is a fundamental biological process. It is the major risk factor for age-related diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, stroke, osteoporosis, arthritis and Alzheimer's, just to name a few. As life expectancy has increased in the 20th century, these diseases have become the leading causes of death. Recent research has identified universal mechanisms that regulate organismal aging and impact all organ systems. Several gene networks that can regulate the rate of aging and multiple age-related diseases have already been discovered. These mechanisms are conserved throughout evolution and many key insights have been garnered from simple model organisms. Manipulation of these networks has been achieved by diet, genetic engineering, and most recently, with drugs. The goal of modern medicine is to increase healthy survival, as opposed to simply longevity. It is now generally acknowledged that increasing health span – the fraction of our life spans free of frailty and debilitating chronic disease – has become a realistic goal. This course will examine the new concept of \"geroscience\" – the molecular, cellular, and genetic foundations of the biology of aging, and how this knowledge can be applied to therapies for age-associated diseases. Course material will be based on the primary research literature. Prerequisites are a background in cell biology, molecular biology and genetics - such as BIOL0470, BIOL0280, BIOL0200, and BIOL0800.",

We investigate flows to design and take advantage of their behavior for engineering solutions (e.g., extracting energy). You will learn to identify a fluid and develop the mathematical framework (differential equations) that describe compressible flow motion/dynamics. We study fundamental thin airfoil, wing, and boundary layer theory. We will consider extracting energy from air flows using wind turbines.

    "description": "Heterogeneous materials appear in nature (polycristals, wood, bone, blood), physical systems ( (un)stable colloidal suspensions) or in engineering applications (fiber-reinforced materials, reinforced rubber in tires). They usually exhibit remarkable physical properties superior to the properties of individual components. Despite being comprised at the microscopic length scale of multiple domains with different physical properties, these materials behave as homogeneous materials and can be assigned macroscopic (effective) physical material-like properties for practical purposes. The course will cover classical and recent analytical, numerical methods for computation of various physical properties (viscous/thermal/dielectric, viscoelastic, thermoelastic, piezoelectric, electrostrictive) of heterogeneous materials that exhibit (non)linear and/or coupled behaviors.",

But is there a more direct way of creating value, through licensing and commercialization to a company, through creating products or services, or through the creation of a new venture? And how can we assess the potential social impact? We will together examine some currently emerging science to establish the methods. Thereafter you will examine the science and technology within your own research group in order to discover value, value that you may possibly be able to exploit. Students must be actively participating in research. Undergraduate students must also be undertaking research (instructor permission is required). Graduate students are requested to contact the instructor when registering.",
