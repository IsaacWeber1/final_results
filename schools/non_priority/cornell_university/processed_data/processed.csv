In Fall of 2015 the United Nations’ General Assembly adopted a resolution titled, “Transforming Our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.” This 35-page resolution includes an elaborate vision statement, a list of principles and commitments, and a list of 17 goals, among many other items. In 2022, the resolution is still very much in effect and having an impact on our world. Upon analyzing or reflecting on the text of the UN resolution and exploring its related goals and topics, we can quickly begin to identify the issues people, organizations, and governments are likely to argue over, or are already arguing over. Thus, UN goal and topic is up for argument, including facts (e.g., climate change) will be contested in one way or another, by someone or some group or another, and arguments of all kinds, formal and informal, will proliferate. It is amid these arguments about our sustainable future that this course will take place. Sustainable Arguments will focus on making and understanding data driven, logical, and rhetorically focused arguments about sustainability that connect to the UN’s Agenda for Sustainable Development.

This course explores the role of design in reshaping the world towards social justice and sustainability. Designing for change requires creating different cultural patterns and worldviews — examining taken-for-granted assumptions, narratives, and myths of the hegemonic cultural model (known as Modernity) that limit our capacity to imagine the world differently. As the world is enmeshed in colossal interconnected crises, it seems that imagination has been funneled to two avenues: techno-solutions to the symptoms of the crises and dystopic futures. This course explores two main ideas: a) alternatives are possible, b) the area of design for change would benefit from exchanges with different cultures and knowledge systems. Designing decolonial futures is about weaving together knowledge from multiple cultures, thus recognizing and creating alternatives based on different ways of understanding the world. Outcome 1: Students will be able to understand what is at stake in the international movement to “decolonize design” and the importance of detaching design from the assumptions, promises, and values of Modernity/Coloniality to generate significant change. Students will be introduced to the main theories and approaches used in decolonial design: decoloniality, pluriversality, epistemologies of the South, transition discourses/design, speculative design, and design for social innovation. Outcome 2: Students will be able to recognize structural features of the Eurocentric Modernity at the root of social inequities and unsustainability (which connect social and environmental crises). Without examining these structures, designers keep trying to solve the symptoms instead of addressing the causes. Particularly, students will reflect upon the legacy of colonialism on society and the natural environment. Outcome 3: Students will be able to recognize that narratives frame the way we design. Creating different futures requires new narratives and visions to reframe the design practice and the meaning of technological innovations. Students will be asked to create new narratives to reframe their design practice/research. Outcome 4: Students will be able to recognize taken-for-granted assumptions and myths of Modernity that hinder the understanding of other cultures, epistemologies, and ontologies—i.e., even when designers want to listen to the Other, the understanding is very limited. Therefore this course aims to enhance the student’s capacity to listen to and collaborate with people from other cultures— recognizing and respecting differences in worldviews, cultural patterns, ways of knowing—to generate change. Outcome 5: Students will be asked to create compelling visual communications, knowledge visualizations, and narratives to communicate the topics discussed in class and their visions of alternative futures to other people.

Offered in New York City at Cornell Tech. Staff. Cities are increasingly recognized as a key level of government for environmental and sustainability policy. As at all levels, politics and policy are intensely intertwined, and perhaps moreso at the local level because the decisions involved often affect constituents directly and intimately - in their neighborhoods, in their homes, in their commutes. This course explores both the politics and the policy of sustainability in the municipal context. Covering a range of sustainability issues - such as air quality, public health, and transportation - it looks at the dynamics of making change happen at the local level, including variations in power among municipal governments; how issues get defined and allocated; how stakeholder management takes place (or doesn’t); how agencies and levels of government interfere with each other; and how best practices can (and cannot) be transferred internationally. The course is reading-intense and includes case studies by historians rather than political scientists. The focus of most readings is on the United States, but students’ research projects will require looking beyond the US and transferring practices to a US city. Outcome 1: Understand the broad forces at play shaping urban sustainability policy, including the key drivers of environmental challenges in cities; the role and limits of municipal government; the way technology and economics shape land use; the way people understand shared public space; how cities change their environments over time; how stakeholders influence policy at the local level; and how racism and other forms of inequality create different environmental outcomes. Outcome 2: Understand the role of the policy advisor to a mayor. Outcome 3: Have a very high-level awareness of key tupes of environmental policies being put in place at the municipal level. Outcome 4: Be able to distinguish among context analysis, problem diagnosis, and solutions in policymaking.

Theory is important as a foundation when it comes to the principals of leadership, organizational behavior, influence, and culture, but in this class we will solidify that underpinning, move forward, and gain an understanding of how to make real-world decisions even when the historical premise of management and power doesn’t apply. How to look for and identify the behaviors of success in people – then let them participate in sustaining the culture, and ultimately the growth, of the company, all the while ensuring they are correctly compensated for their performance and contribution. As a leader how do you make the people decisions that will ultimately result in growth – your own and the company’s. Utilizing the broad theories of management, corporate structure, and talent as a base to ‘think from,’ we will take a macro approach to studying power and leadership, with a focus on organizational culture. The cases we discuss in this course will give students the opportunity to apply their own creative thinking, rooted in knowledge, but about the actual situations depicted, all the while learning how to lead and empower performance within their organization. Learnings will also be gained directly from the real world, specifically the Instructor’s experience in building and sustaining growth within companies. Using corporate culture as a driver, his companies have remarkably lower turnover as compared with the competition. From our discussions, you will piece together the important aspects to drive culture growth/sustainability and to drastically decrease turnover; flat organizations, entrepreneurial environments, role diversity, and increased responsibility.

PUBPOL 3890 - Rewilding the American West: A Policy Incubator,"Fall. 4 credits. Letter grades only. D. Kriner. Debates over the proper aims, scope, and methods of environmental policy in America are as old as the conservation movement, from Gifford Pinchot’s push for the responsible and productive use of public lands to John Muir’s crusade for strict preservation. Over the last forty years, a growing number of scholars and policymakers have embraced a new approach to science-based conservation: rewilding. The term has been used by activists, ecologists, and policymakers to embrace a range of policy proscriptions, from the restoration of wide-ranging wilderness areas and large predators to restoring Pleistocene era megafauna or their ecological equivalents, to landscape restoration through the reintroduction of appropriate species, to productive land abandonment. However, a core principle uniting these disparate approaches is an emphasis on restoring biodiversity and promoting sustainability through the protection and enhancement of wilderness areas. The rewilding movement has also begun to influence public policy, offering innovative solutions to old and new policy challenges, including mitigating the impacts of climate change. Outcome 1: Understand core scientific concepts undergirding rewilding practices. Outcome 2: Apply those concepts to thinking about policy solutions to contemporary problems.

Prerequisite: introductory coursework in economics and finance, along with basic proficiency in Excel. Recommended prerequisite: familiarity with algebra and calculus. Co-meets with . A. Prabowo. Climate change presents a dilemma. Under the Paris Agreement, countries of the world committed to the goal of limiting warming to no more than two degrees Celsius from pre-industrial times. Scientists have warned that exceeding the threshold would increase the risks of heatwaves, drought, and extreme weather. Achieving the target, however, requires collective efforts to reduce emissions. Households, businesses, and governments would have to radically shift to cleaner energy supply and greener activities, which will take a great deal of financial resources. Sustainable finance attempts to address this challenge by integrating finance as a discipline into the sustainability framework. Designed for policy students, this course considers the perspectives of policymakers rather than business actors in navigating the green transition. Case studies will be drawn primarily from Southeast Asia, which is considered one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, although much of the framework is also applicable to other regions around the globe. Outcome 1: Identify the state of climate change in Southeast Asia and around the globe. Outcome 2: Recognize the role of government, and the limit thereof, in addressing climate change.
