DATA_ENG 200-0 Foundations of Data Science (1 Unit),"This course will cover the fundamentals of data science and the context within which this field operates. Students will learn how to design their data analysis by learning to think critically about what questions are answerable with data and they will learn about common pitfalls in data analytics such as algorithmic bias and best practices for handling the sensitive data of others. It will also introduce students to computational thinking, a methodology for problem-solving the technological challenges they will encounter as data scientists. This course will also introduce the steps of the data science lifecycle and common tools and techniques for data science. We will cover data exploration, the principles of data cleaning and integration, version control, and building reproducible data science pipelines.
