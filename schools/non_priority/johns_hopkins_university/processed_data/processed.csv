SA.630.726. Quantitative Approaches to Risk Assessment. 4 Credits.,"The classical approach to decision theory builds on a three step iterative process: decision-makers assign probabilities to different possible outcomes, they generate welfare estimates depending upon the different outcomes (relative costs and benefits) for the decision makers involved, and they calculate the expected values of different contingencies. The process is iterative in the sense that decision-makers reassess probabilities as they gain more information (it is Bayesian), they also make assessments as they learn more about the welfare implications for other important actors (it is game-theoretical), and they learn more about their own possibilities to control events (it is causal). The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the quantitative techniques used in each stage of this process. The course begins by exploring the assignment of probabilities both on the basis of prior assumptions and using more advanced techniques (like Monte Carlo simulations). It then shows how these probabilities can be updated in a Bayesian manner as a result of new information. It looks at how these probabilities can be fed into decision making with multiple actors (through game theory). And it concludes with techniques to evaluate the overall success of the decision-making process. Students will need basic statistics and principles of economics in order to get the most out of this course. Basic skills using spreadsheets would also be of use.

SA.554.103. Russia: The Making (and Unmaking) of a Super Power. 4 Credits.,"Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has upended the European security order and restructured global geopolitics and commodity markets. As of this writing, the war’s outcome is uncertain, and the endgame is debated but unknown. The unfolding tragedy has renewed interest in imperialism as an organizing principle of Russian state formation, identity, foreign policy, and economic development. The course examines tensions among these factors to analyze and explain recurring cycles in Russian history as a rising and declining empire. From this vantage point, we gain deeper perspective on Russia and Ukraine as primary protagonists in the geopolitical tensions that emerged in Europe after the USSR dissolved.The central premise of the course is that Putin’s Russia, to paraphrase Mark Twain, does not repeat but rhymes with the Tsarist and Soviet eras. The content is structured chronologically and thematically to enable comparative analysis of key events in Russian and Soviet history that have a bearing on contemporary questions. The first half of the course covers the role of empire in Russian history up to the collapse of the USSR and end of the Cold War. The second half examines the rise of Putinism, emergence of hostilities in US-Russian relations, origins of conflict over Ukraine, and consequences for energy markets and Sino-Russian relations. Thematic topics include the impact of war on Russian society and politics; the consolidation and collapse of autocratic power; the evolution and resolution of conflict in Soviet/Russian foreign relations, and the potential for political change in Russia and a negotiated endgame to the Ukraine War. The course concludes with consideration of policy options for the post-war Russia.

The soaring popularity of investing in ESG owes much to its advocates’ claims that it helps the end-investor with two challenges. First, climate change and related long-term societal risks increasingly have the potential to affect financial markets, especially over longer investment horizons. Asset owners want to ensure that their asset managers are properly considering these long-term risks. Second, end-investors want to align their investments with their values, especially around the achievement of the Paris Climate Agreement Goals and the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

AS.001.217. FYS: From Cell Phones to Hydrogen Cars: Are the Needed Metals Sustainable?. 3 Credits.,"Where do critical metals that we use every day for our technologically advanced society come from? We will discuss questions surrounding the exploration and ownership of metallic resources and their exploitation. We benefit, but at what cost to others? To address these questions, we look at individual critical metals and their exploitation in a variety of countries from Africa, to South America, and Southeast Asia including Australia. As an example, cobalt is currently crucial for electric car batteries: see the book by Siddharth Kara (2022) ""Cobalt Red: How the Blood of the Congo Powers Our Lives"". Should we alternatively get cobalt by the proposed mining of the deep ocean floor? Who has the right to do that? Weekly readings and discussions, and guest speakers lead to mini-research projects on such topics.",https://e-catalogue.jhu.edu/course-descriptions/as-first-year-seminars/,5.5,Hydrogen,hydrogen_phrases-5,"{""hydrogen"": 1}"
AS.001.229. FYS: Medical Wastes. 3 Credits.,"This course combines historical and ethnographic investigations of the wastefulness of modern medicine in ecological, economic, and bodily terms. Why, in the past half-century, has the production of medical waste skyrocketed? Who bears the environmental costs of the incineration of disposable medical technologies? What new sustainable solutions might be retrieved from past practices? At the intersection of medicine, science, and humanities, this course explores the human and planetary costs of our wasteful healthcare systems, and what can be done to envision a more sustainable future. Readings will be centered in historical and ethnographic investigation but will stretch across other humanities and social science disciplines, in conjunction with primary source readings from medical and public health journals, lawsuits and Congressional hearings, and new approaches to materials design for sustainable healthcare. Experiential partnerships with local, regional, and international advocacy groups will be important for this course as well, including the Planetary Health Alliance based in the Bloomberg Center in Washington DC, the Sustainability Leadership Council of Johns Hopkins University, and local environmental justice advocacy surrounding the Curtis Bay Energy medical incinerator, which was recently the subject of the largest environmental fine in Maryland history.",https://e-catalogue.jhu.edu/course-descriptions/as-first-year-seminars/,4.5,Sustainability,sustainability_and_policy-4,"{""sustainability"": 1}"
