The\nUniversity offers innovative, inclusive, and distinctive educational experiences to a broad cross section of the\npopulation in a comprehensive range of disciplines at the baccalaureate, master\u2019s, doctoral, and professional\ndegree levels. Through collaborative pursuits, scholarly research, creative endeavors, and dedicated public\nservice, the University gives significant priority to addressing societal problems, particularly those prevalent in\nurban communities.\nCore Values\nThe following institutional core values guide the promotion of student learning and success, faculty scholarship\nand research, and community engagement at Morgan:\nExcellence. Excellence in teaching, research, scholarship, creative endeavors, student services, and in all\naspects of the University\u2019s operations is continuously pursued at Morgan to ensure institutional\neffectiveness and efficiency.\nIntegrity. At Morgan, honest communications, ethical behavior, and accountability for words and deeds are\nexpected from all members of the University community.\nRespect. Each person at Morgan is to be treated with respect and dignity and is to be treated equitably in all\nsituations.\nDiversity. A broad diversity of people and ideas are welcomed and supported at Morgan as essential to\nquality education in a global interdependent society. Students will have reasonable and affordable access to a\ncomprehensive range of high quality educational programs and services.\nInnovation. Morgan encourages and supports its faculty, staff, and students in all forms of scholarship\nincluding the discovery and application of knowledge in teaching and learning and in developing innovative\nproducts and processes.\nLeadership. Morgan seeks to provide rigorous academic curricula and challenging co-curricular\nopportunities to promote the development of leadership qualities in students and to facilitate leadership\ndevelopment among faculty, staff, and students.\nSTUDENTS\u2019 RIGHT TO KNOW\nFAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), also known as the Buckley Amendment, gives students the right to: (1)\ninspect and review their educational records; (2) consent to release educational records to a third party; (3) challenge information included\nin the educational records; and (4) be notified of their rights under FERPA. It is the policy of Morgan State University to comply with the\nterms and conditions of FERPA.\nInspection and Review of Educational Records\nFERPA requires that a college or University have procedures for allowing students to inspect and review their\neducational records.With certain important exceptions, the term \u201ceducational record\u201d means any record (in\nhandwriting, print, tapes, film, computer, or other medium) directly related to a student and maintained by the\nUniversity. Among the information that may be compiled on a student, but is not defined as an educational\nrecord under FERPA are personal records kept by faculty members and/or University officials for their own use;\nrecords made by a physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or other recognized professional or paraprofessional\nused in connection with the treatment of the student;the records compiled and maintained by campus security for\nthe purpose of law enforcement; certain employment records; and certain alumni records.Students do not have\nthe right to inspect and review the financial statement of the students\u2019 parents;letters of recommendation for\nwhich the student waived his or her right of access; records maintained before January 1,1975; records related to\nan application to the University where the applicant was denied admission; and/or any other information\nexcluded from FERPA\u2019s definition of educational record. Students may inspect and review their educational\nrecords upon written request to the Registrar in the Office of Records and Registration.The Registrar will direct\nthe written request to the appropriate records custodian and within a reasonable period of time, but in no case\nlonger than 45 days, the appropriate records custodian will provide the student with an opportunity to inspect and\nreview the requested records, so long as the requested records are covered by and are not exempted under\nFERPA.The University may charge a fee for copying and is under no obligation to certify every record requested\nby or copied for a student.\nConsent to Release Records\nMorgan State University will disclose information from a student\u2019s educational record only with the written consent of the student. Except that a\nstudent\u2019s educational record may, even in the absence of the student\u2019s express writ- ten consent, be disclosed to parents of students who\nare \u201cdependent\u201d as defined by the Internal Revenue Code; to court or law enforcement officials in compliance with a judicial order or\nlawfully issued subpoena; to accred- iting organizations; to appropriate parties in a health or safety emergency; to officials conducting\nstudies for the University; federal, state, and local educational authorities who audit or regulate educational programs; officials of another\nschool in which a student seeks to enroll; and University officials including faculty, administrators, staff, trustees, members of University\njudicial bodies, including students, who have a \u201clegitimate educational interest\u201d in the record. A University official has a legitimate educational\ninterest if such official is performing a task related to the discipline of a student; performing a service or benefit relating to the student or\nthe student\u2019s family; or the official is maintaining the safety and security of the campus.The University may also disclose the results of\nany disciplinary proceeding against an alleged perpetrator of a violent crime to the alleged victim of that crime.\nFinally, the University may disclose without a student\u2019s consent certain \u201cdirectory information\u201d such as a student\u2019s name, photograph, parent\u2019s\nname, address, telephone number, date and place of birth, major field of study, dates of attendance, degrees and/or awards received,\nparticipation in officially recognized activities, height and weight of members of athletic teams, and most recent educational institution attended. A\nstudent who objects to the disclosure of \u201cdirectory information\u201d must provide annual written notice to the Registrar in the Office of\nRecords and\nRegistration within three weeks of the first day of Fall semester classes not to disclose any or all of the categor- ies of directory\ninformation related to that student. There may be circumstances where students will want to grant an individual or organization access\nto their records. Frequent examples include employers, employment agencies, counselors, attorneys, and honorific societies. Requests for\ndisclosure of educational records should be made in writing to the Registrar in the Office of Records and Registration.Within a\nreasonable period of time, but in no case longer than 45 days, the appropriate University official will disclose to the individual or organiz-\nation identified by the student as having permission to review the requested records, so long as the requested records are covered and\nare not exempted under FERPA.The University may charge a fee for copying and is under no obligation to certify every record\ndisclosed at the request of or on behalf of a student.\nIIII. Correct Information in the Record\nWith the exception of grades, an instructor\u2019s procedure or judgment in awarding grades, students have the right to ask to have educational\nrecords corrected that they believe are inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of their privacy rights. Students at the University\nwho wish to challenge information in their educational record that they believe is inaccurate, misleading, or in violation of their privacy rights\nmust submit a written request to the Registrar in the Office of Records and Registration.The Registrar will direct the request to the\nUniversity official responsible for the record in question. After reviewing the request within a reasonable period of time, the University\nwill communicate to the student in writing a decision about whether the University will amend the record.\nIf the decision of the University is not to amend the record, a student has the right to appeal by writing to the Vice President for\nAcademic Affairs (VPAA), requesting a hearing on the matter.The VPAA will notify the student in writing of the time, place, and\ndate of the hearing. The hearing officer will be a University official appointed by the VPAA.The student shall have a full and fair\nopportunity to present evidence related to the matter and/ or educational record in question.Within a reasonable period of time\nfollowing the hearing, the student will be notified in writing of the University\u2019s decision. If the University finds as result of\nevidence presented at the hearing that the educational record contains inaccurate, misleading information or that the record as\npresently constituted violates the privacy rights of the student, the University will amend the record. On the other hand, if the University\ndecides after its review of the evidence presented at the hearing that the information in the student\u2019s record is not inaccurate, misleading, or\nin violation of privacy rights, the student has a right to include in his or her record a statement commenting on the challenged information\nand/or a statement setting forth reasons for disagreeing with the decision.The student\u2019s statement will be maintained as part of the\neducational record and shall be disclosed whenever the University discloses the contested portion of the record.\nIVV. Notice of Privacy Rights\nThe preceding review of rights and procedures is meant to inform students of the rights accorded to them by the\nFamily Educational Rights and Privacy Act. Pursuant to \u00a799.7 of the FERPA regulations, students at the University\nare provided with annual notification of their FERPA rights via the University website. For a full understanding\nof the terms, conditions, rights, and exceptions found in FERPA, students are encouraged to read the entire act\nwhich is found in 20 United States Code Annotated (USCA) \u00a71232g et. seq. Students who believe that their rights\nunder FERPA have been abridged by the University may file a written complaint with the Director, Family Policy\nCompliance Office, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue S.W., Washington, DC 20202-5920.\nApproved Board of Regents\nMay 5, 2015\nPOLICY ON STUDENT RESIDENCY CLASSIFICATION FOR\nADMISSION AND TUITION PURPOSES\nI. POLICY\nA. Purpose\nTo extend the benefits of higher education while encouraging the economical use of the\nState's resources,1 it is the policy of the Board of Regents of Morgan State University to\nrecognize the tuition categories of in-state and out-of-state students for the purpose of\nadmission and assessing tuition at the University.\nB. Burden of Proof\nThe person seeking in-state status shall have the burden of proving by clear and\nconvincing evidence that he or she satisfies the requirements and standards set forth in\nthis Policy. Assignment of in-state or out-of-state status will be made upon a review of\nthe totality of facts known or presented to it.\nC. In-state Status\nTo qualify for in-state tuition, a student must demonstrate that, for at least twelve (12)\nconsecutive months immediately prior to and including the last date available to register\nfor courses in the semester/term for which the student seeks in-state tuition status, the\nstudent had the continuous intent to:\n1. Make Maryland his or her permanent home; and\n2. Abandon his or her former home state or domicile; and\n3. Reside in Maryland indefinitely; and\n4. Reside in Maryland primarily for a purpose other than that of attending an\neducational institution in Maryland.\nSatisfying all of the requirements in Section II (and Section III, when applicable) of this\npolicy demonstrates continuous intent and qualifies a student for in-state tuition.\n1Annotated Code of Maryland, Education Article, \u00a714-101 and \u00a714-104.\nStudents not entitled to in-state status under this policy shall be assigned out-of-state\nstatus for admission and tuition purposes.\nD. Presumption\nEither of the following circumstances raises a presumption that the student is residing in\nthe State of Maryland primarily for the purpose of attending an educational institution\nand therefore, does not qualify for in-state status under this policy:\n1. A student is attending school or living outside Maryland at the time of application for\nadmission to the University, or\n2. A student is Financially Dependent on a person who is not a resident of Maryland.\nThis presumption may be rebutted. The student bears the burden of rebutting the\npresumption. See \"III. Rebuttal Evidence\" below.\nII. REQUIREMENTS\nBefore a request for classification to in-state status will be considered, a student must\ncomply with all of the following requirements for a period of at least twelve (12)\nconsecutive months immediately prior to and including the last date available to register\nfor courses in the semester/term for which the student seeks in-state tuition status. The\nstudent must demonstrate he or she:\nA. Owns or possesses, and has continuously occupied, including during weekends,\nbreaks and vacations, living quarters in Maryland. The student must provide evidence\nof a genuine deed or lease and documentation of rent payments made. In lieu of a\ndeed or lease, a notarized affidavit from a landlord showing the address, name of the\nstudent as occupant, term of residence, and history of rent payments made will be\nconsidered. As an alternative, a student may demonstrate that he or she shares living\nquarters in Maryland which are owned or rented and occupied by a parent, legal\nguardian or spouse.\nB. Has substantially all of his or her personal property, such as household effects,\nfurniture and pets in Maryland.\nC. Has paid Maryland income tax on all taxable income including all taxable income\nearned outside the State and has filed a Maryland tax return.\nD. Has registered all owned or leased motor vehicles in Maryland.\nE. Possesses a valid Maryland driver's license, if licensed.\nF. Is registered to vote in Maryland, if registered to vote.\nG. Receives no public assistance from a state other than the State of Maryland or from\na city, county or municipal agency other than one in Maryland.\nH. Has a legal ability under Federal and Maryland law to live permanently without\ninterruption in Maryland.\nI. Has rebutted the presumption that he or she is in Maryland primarily to attend an\neducational institution, if the student's circumstances have raised the presumption.\nIII. REBUTTAL EVIDENCE\nSatisfying the requirements listed in paragraphs A through I of Section II, does not rebut\nthe presumption that a student is in Maryland primarily to attend an educational\ninstitution. To overcome the presumption, a student must present additional evidence.\nTo determine a student's intent, the University will evaluate evidence of a student's\nobjectively verifiable conduct. Evidence that does not document a period of at least\ntwelve (12) consecutive months immediately prior to and including the last date\navailable to register for courses in the semester/term for which the student seeks\nin-state tuition status is generally considered an unfavorable factor under this policy.\nEvidence of intent must be clear and convincing and will be evaluated not only by the\namount presented but also based upon the reliability, authenticity, credibility and\nrelevance of the evidence.\nThe absence of objective, relevant evidence is generally considered an unfavorable\nfactor. A student's statement of intent to remain in Maryland in the future is generally\nnot considered to be objective evidence under this policy.\nAdditional evidence that will be considered includes, but is not limited to, the following:\nA. Source of financial support:\n1. Maryland employment and earnings history through sources beyond those incident\nto enrollment as a student in an educational institution e.g., beyond support provided by\nwork study, scholarships, grants, stipends, aid, student loans, etc. (Tuition costs will be\nconsidered as a student expense only to the extent tuition exceeds the amount of any\neducational scholarships, grants, student loans, etc.), or\n2. Evidence the student is Financially Dependent upon a person who is a resident of\nMaryland.\nB. Substantial participation as a member of a professional, social, community, civic,\npolitical, athletic or religious organization in Maryland, including professionally related\nschool activities that demonstrate a commitment to the student's community or to the\nState of Maryland.\nC. Registration as a Maryland resident with the Selective Service, if male.\nD. Evidence showing the student uses his or her Maryland address as his or her sole\naddress of record for all purposes including on health and auto insurance records,\nbank accounts, tax records, loan and scholarship records, school records, military\nrecords, leases, etc.\nE. An affidavit from a person unrelated to the student that provides objective,\nrelevant evidence of a student's conduct demonstrating the student's intent to live\npermanently in Maryland.\nIV. NON-RESIDENTS WHO MAY TEMPORARILY QUALIFY FOR IN-STATE\nSTATUS In addition, persons with the following status shall be accorded the benefits\nof in-state status for the period in which they hold such status:\nA. A full-time or part-time (at least 50 percent time) regular employee of the\nUniversity.\nB. The spouse or Financially Dependent child of a full-time or part-time (at least 50\npercent time) regular employee of the University.\nC. An active duty member of the Armed Forces of the United States whose home of\nresidency is Maryland or one who resides in, or is stationed in, or is domiciled in\nMaryland, or the spouse or a Financially Dependent child of such a person. Students\nthat qualify under this provision will retain in-state status for tuition purposes as long\nas they are Continuously Enrolled regardless of a change in military assignment or\nstatus of the active member of the military.\nD. A veteran of the United States Armed Forces who presents documentation that\nhe or she was honorably discharged, and currently resides, or is domiciled, in the\nState.\nE. A veteran who resides in Maryland and was discharged after serving 90 days or\nmore on active duty, who enrolls at Morgan State University within 3 years of\ndischarge, and is pursuing a program of education with educational assistance under\n38 U.S.C. \u00a73001 or 38 U.S.C. \u00a73301.

The spouse or child of a veteran, provided that:\n(1) the veteran was discharged after serving 90 days or more on active duty\nless than three years before the date of the spouse or child\u2019s enrollment at Morgan\nState University(or in the case of a spouse or child seeking benefits under the Post-\n9/11 G.I. Bill, the veteran died in the line of duty on or after September 11, 2001, but\nless than three years before the date of the spouse or child\u2019s enrollment). ;\n(2) the spouse or child is entitled to educational assistance under the Post-\n9/11 G.I. Bill 38 U.S.C. \u00a73319 and 38 U.S.C. \u00a73311(B)(9);\n(3) the spouse or child currently resides in Maryland; and\n(4) the spouse or child is pursuing a program of education with educational\nassistance under 38 U.S.C. \u00a73001 or 38 U.S.C. \u00a73301.\n-4-\n(5) This section F of the Policy shall be effective as of July 1, 2015.\nG.

Effective July 1, 2011, an undocumented immigrant individual (not including\nnon- immigrant aliens within the meaning of \u00a71101(A)(15) of the Aliens and\nNationality Title of the United States Code) is eligible to pay a tuition rate equivalent\nto the resident tuition rate at the University, if the individual:\na.

As such, the university is situated on an\nopen campus in the northeastern portion of Baltimore City. The university comprises approximately 158 acres and is\nimpacted on its boundaries by surrounding residential communities and retail activities. The overall security program\nof the university is focused on providing police protection and security services to a population which includes\napproximately 7,000 students and 1,500 faculty members and other employees. Access to campus facilities and\nactivities is accomplished by means of an identification card which is issued to each member of the community.\nThis is the primary means of identifying community members on the campus and the display of the card on an\nouter garment is consistently encouraged and, upon request of an officer of the university, the identification card must\nbe shown. Residential life facilities are staffed by employees of the Office of Residence Life, who assume\nresponsibility for controlling access to on/off campus residential facilities. In addition, con- tinuous exterior\nsecurity is provided during the hours of darkness by dedicated security officers, regular police patrols,\nplainclothes officers and a camera system. The university makes every effort to ensure that campus facilities,\ns\nbuildings, and grounds are designed and maintained in uch a manner as to promote safety\nand security, and reduce the opportunity for criminal activity. In this light, emphasis is focused on protective\nlighting, landscaping and grounds keeping, and identifying areas of the campus which may contribute to crime\nconducive conditions.

In addition, emergency security\ntelephones (\u201cblue phones\u201d) are installed at selected locations throughout the university campus.\nThe Department of Police and Public Safety publishes news safety and security brochures, and provides\noral presentations to all segments of the campus community on a frequent basis to educate community\nmembers on police policies and procedures. Students and employees are reminded of recurring or significant crime\nproblems\nbeing experienced on the campus and their role and responsibility in reducing their vulnerability in becoming\ncrime victims.\nThe Department of Police and Public Safety publishes pamphlets on various topics of Crime Prevention which\nare available to all students, faculty, and staff members. Topics include: Police Protection and Security Services,\nGeneral Crime Prevention Techniques, Campus Watch, Operation I.D., Rape and Sexual Assault, Date Rape,\nand Drug and Alcohol Abuse.

Or, with the prior written permission of the\nDepartment Chairperson in which their major is located, seniors may elect to have the credit earned for graduate courses\napplied towards a baccalaureate degree at Morgan. The credit earned, however, may be applied to satisfy degree\nrequirements only once; either to complete requirements for the bachelor\u2019s degree or, to complete graduate degree\nrequirements. In order to be officially registered in a graduate course, undergraduates must:\ncomplete a form requesting to take graduate courses prior to the start of the graduate course;\nhave their request form signed by the Chairperson (or the Chairperson\u2019s designee) of the department in which the\ngraduate course is taught;\nhave their request signed by the Dean of the School of Graduate Studies;\ncomplete a Drop/Add form with the graduate course(s) in which the student seeks enrollment filed with the Dean of\nthe School of Graduate; and,\nbe registered for the graduate course(s) by the School of Graduate Studies.\nThis policy applies to qualified seniors interested in enrolling in graduate courses. Undergraduates improperly enrolled\nin graduate courses may be administratively withdrawn from the course. Undergraduates who may be admitted to\naccelerated bachelor\u2019s to master\u2019s degree programs should consult their program requirements on registering for and the\napplication of graduate courses to degree requirements.\nADMINISTRATORS\nOF THE\nUNIVERSITY\nDAVID WILSON, Ed.D., President; B.S. and M.Ed., Tuskegee University; Ed.M. and Ed.D., Harvard University.\nGLORIA GIBSON, Ph.D., Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs; B.A. and M.A., Southern Illinois\nUniversity; and Ph.D., Indiana University Bloomington.\nKARA MILES TURNER, Ph.D., Associate Provost for Enrollment Management and Student Academic Support Services;\nB.S., Rutgers University; M.A. and Ph.D., Duke University.\nDON-TERRY VEAL, Ph.D., Chief of Staff to the President; B.A., Southern University at New Orleans; MPA., University\nof Mississippi; Ph.D., Norther Illinios University.\nCLARA I.
