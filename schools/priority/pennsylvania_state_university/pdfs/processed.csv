AFAM 435N: Black Ecologies,"African and African Diasporic peoples have been central to the creation and transformation of global ecologies and landscapes. As the birthplace of humankind, the African continent features the longest archaeological record in the world, with abundant, yet often underrepresented, material and historical evidence for remarkable Indigenous African innovations in the areas of technology, food production, and resource and land use. This course speciﬁcally examines Black ecologies preceding and then radically transformed by the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade. Beginning in the late ﬁfteenth century, the enslavement of millions of Africans and their forced translocation to the Americas and Caribbean precipitated ecological transformations on all sides of the Atlantic, as African peoples, knowledge, resources and ecological inheritances were appropriated by the European mercantile system. Enslaved Africans transformed American landscapes via extractive industries of plantations and mines and suffered the emergence of toxic landscapes and disease alongside Native American communities. Africans also recreated African ecologies as they created livelihoods and landscapes of resistance and freedom in the Americas. The legacies of the Atlantic Era maintain a persistent dynamic in which African and African Diasporic communities experience disproportionate burdens of environmental injustice today. The concept of Black ecologies reflects the marginality, systemic racism and dispossession experienced by Black peoples and their landscapes. Black ecologies also allow us to understand African and African Diasporic ecological innovations, resistance and resilience, and the pathways to future sustainability and justice they promise.

AFAM 467: African American Novel II,"This course examines the African American novel, its forms, and its traditions starting during the Harlem Renaissance. It follows the genre's evolution into the twenty-ﬁrst century, outlining the relationships among the texts that form the body of African American narrative as well as the relationships of those texts to the constantly shifting cultural and political realities surrounding their writing. From the Renaissance heralded by Alain Locke, through the Civil Rights and Black Power Movements -and their attendant Black Arts Movement- and into the era of the Movement for Black Lives, course readings encompass a broad range of styles and genres, from realism, naturalism, and naturalist primitivism, through the experimental forms, magical realism, and ""postrace aesthetics"" of later times. The course invites students to think critically about the African American novel as a socially and politically engaged form, and to identify and analyze the long tradition of resistance that variously informs its development. Authors covered in the course might include major ﬁgures such as Claude McKay, Zora Neale Hurston, Nella Larsen, Wallace Thurman, Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, Ann Petry, James Baldwin, Ishmael Reed, Earnest Gaines, Alice Walker, Toni Morrison, Toni Cade Bambara, Octavia Butler, Gayle Jones, Samuel Delany, Charles Johnson, John Edgar Wideman, Colson Whitehead, and others. Still, the course gives due attention to lesser known/studied materials from the period, including graphic novels, satire, speculative ﬁction, performance novels, and various other experimental forms. Course readings and instruction give particular attention to how African American novels of the twentieth and twenty-ﬁrst centuries variously engage social identity categories, like race, gender, class, and sexuality, and how they engage and resist various literary conventions associated with naturalism, modernism, and postmodernism. The course also traces the development of new thematic and aesthetic interests in a generation of writers whose ﬁction has been influenced by the explosion of interest in the graphic novel, the popularity of cultural forms such as hip hop, and the ascendancy of the digital age. Scholarly readings accompany primary texts to give students a sense of the critical work that has gone into and continues to go on in the study of African American literature. In this course, students learn how to analyze literature, do close and careful readings of texts, conduct related research, and write persuasively about literary works. Assignments and discussions are designed such that students may engage with course ﬁgures and materials within their historical milieus.

ANTH 221N: Ancient Maya: Sacred Blood & Conjured Serpent,"The Ancient Maya: Sacred Blood and Conjured Serpent. ANTH 221N Ancient Maya Civilization (3) (GS;GH;IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. Great civilizations emerged independently in several parts of the world beginning about 5500 years ago. Most students have had some exposure to the great Old World civilizations (Mesopotamia, Egypt, China), but know comparatively little about their counterparts in the New World. Among these, the Classic Maya (AD 250-900) are the most familiar, and are heavily featured in popular culture. Many students have (or will) visit Maya sites as tourists, and be impressed by the flamboyant archaeological remains of these ancient people. Despite their visibility, the Maya are widely misunderstood and heavily sensationalized. ANTH 221N traces the development of ancient Maya culture from about 10000 BC through its eventual conquest by the Spaniards in the 16th century. The primary focus will be on the Classic period, when Maya civilization achieved unparalleled heightsin architecture, art, astronomy, mathematics, and writing. The course content makes extensive use of images of sites, artifacts, and artwork to introduce and immerse students to the particularities of the Ancient Maya worldview. The Maya were participants in a much wider tradition of complex civilization in the region archaeologists call Mesoamerica, and several lectures will place them in this more general context. A good amount of content in this course will come from research done by members of the Penn State Anthropology Dept., which has a long tradition of Mesoamerican/Maya research since the early 1960s, and has heavily influenced both the study of Mesoamerican societies and complex cultures in general. Content and topics in the course will also situate Maya peoples, both ancient and modern, in relation to important topics in the contemporary world such as environmental sustainability and degradation, ethnic identity, and state formation.

ANTH 240N: Livelihoods and Ecosystems: Anthropological Approaches to,"This course provides an anthropological understanding of the relationship between human subsistence and environment. The impacts of environmental change on human societies, and the roles those societies play in ecological modiﬁcation, have deep roots in human evolution. This class focuses on providing students with tools to understand the foundations and cross-cultural expressions of resource use, environmental transformation, and their ecological interactions. The class has three goals: 1) introduce students to ways of thinking about ecological and social factors that shape variability in how humans deﬁne, use, and consume resources, 2) provide students the opportunity to explore archaeological, ethnographic, and ecological evidence of the interaction between human livelihoods and habitats across the entirety of the human experience, 3) utilize those concepts and evidence to investigate variability in contemporary livelihoods, socio-ecological systems, and the dilemmas we all face in natural resource use and sustainability. Regarding the ﬁrst goal, students are introduced to the natural science of conservation biology and community ecology, along with influential concepts in the social science of decision-making and cultural institutions of resource management. We review key models of ecosystem dynamics and social interaction from evolutionary ecology, disturbance ecology, niche construction, common property theory, and political ecology to approach questions about consumption, complex socio-ecological systems, and the role of humans in food webs and trophic interactions. The course then investigates archaeological and paleo-ecological evidence concerning the evolution of human subsistence systems, global settlement, intensiﬁcation, and their implications for understanding environmental change over the last two million years. We take the broadest possible anthropological approach: we explore the diversity of ways that humans have made a living in the past, and investigate a wide variety of contemporary systems of resource use. We begin with the emergence of subsistence regimes among the earliest members of our genus and variability in environmental conditions through the Pleistocene. We then discuss the spread of modern humans and arguments concerning the ecological impact of people in the New Worlds as humans ﬁrst colonized Australia, the Americas, and islands of Paciﬁc and Indian Oceans. Finally, students investigate contemporary Indigenous systems of resource use and food production, exploring interactions between people and culturally constructed environments, commensal relationships between humans and non-human plants and animals, processes of intensiﬁcation, and ecosystem function. The course incorporates these concepts with studies of inequality into new ways of understanding global issues of conservation, economics, and policy impinging on environmental change.

ANTH 375Q: Anthropology of Food Honors,"This course is an anthropological approach to understanding temporal and spatial variation in human food consumption and nutrition: why do we eat what we eat? To answer this question, we approach it from multiple perspectives: biological, evolutionary, ecological and social. In this course, students will investigate how food tastes, preferences, and diets of different individuals and societies both in the past and present are affected by genetic variation, by processes of individual and cultural learning, by evolutionary and ecological forces and histories of ecological and social interaction, by existing social contexts and structures, and by global political and economic forces. Topics include a broad survey of human and nonhuman primate diets and their physiological and behavioral correlates; theories of optimal diet breadth and prey choice; fossil and archaeological evidence for early human diets; genetic adaptations to diet; metabolic syndrome; food security; food taboos; the origins and cross cultural uses of spices; ecological impacts of hunting, gathering, and agropastoralism especially relative to food webs, biodiversity and sustainability; cultural diversity in the social uses and meanings of food and the sharing of food and how sociopolitical contexts have shaped the overexploitation of certain resources throughout history. Students will come away from this course with an understanding of the diversity of human foodways through time and space: how biology, culture, and ecology interact to shape the food we eat, and how the food we eat shapes us.

ANTH 434N: Black Ecologies,"African and African Diasporic peoples have been central to the creation and transformation of global ecologies and landscapes. As the birthplace of humankind, the African continent features the longest archaeological record in the world, with abundant, yet often underrepresented, material and historical evidence for remarkable Indigenous African innovations in the areas of technology, food production, and resource and land use. This course speciﬁcally examines Black ecologies preceding and then radically transformed by the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade. Beginning in the late ﬁfteenth century, the enslavement of millions of Africans and their forced translocation to the Americas and Caribbean precipitated ecological transformations on all sides of the Atlantic, as African peoples, knowledge, resources and ecological inheritances were appropriated by the European mercantile system. Enslaved Africans transformed American landscapes via extractive industries of plantations and mines and suffered the emergence of toxic landscapes and disease alongside Native American communities. Africans also recreated African ecologies as they created livelihoods and landscapes of resistance and Undergraduate - The Pennsylvania State University 2024-2025 3393 freedom in the Americas. The legacies of the Atlantic Era maintain a persistent dynamic in which African and African Diasporic communities experience disproportionate burdens of environmental injustice today. The concept of Black ecologies reflects the marginality, systemic racism and dispossession experienced by Black peoples and their landscapes. Black ecologies also allow us to understand African and African Diasporic ecological innovations, resistance and resilience, and the pathways to future sustainability and justice they promise.

ARCH 170N: Introduction to Sustainable Architecture,"US buildings account for almost 40% of national CO2 emissions, 39% of the US total energy consumption, and 60% of US electricity alone. Worldwide, buildings consume nearly 40% of the world's energy, 25% of its wood, and 15% of its water. Building construction and use contribute signiﬁcantly to global climate change. The way we design our built environment has a signiﬁcant impact on consumption statistics, which is why we must consider the global environmental and health effects of buildings during the planning, design, and construction process. This course provides a broad exploration of the art and science of sustainable architecture. Architecture produces cultural artifacts with meaning. Yet, inhabiting and using architecture has a distinct and measurable impact on both local and global environments. Scientiﬁcally, this course investigates passive and active energy systems for buildings, environmental components of material production and use, and site and building design effects on the water cycle, clean air, local ecosystems, and food production. Students will calculate energy consumption and generation scenarios, produce a life-cycle analysis of a familiar product, evaluate a building based on current green building certiﬁcation strategies, and evaluate biological impacts over the local and regional scale. Aesthetically, this course investigates vernacular solutions to 3420 Architecture (ARCH) physical human comfort, and demonstrates the artistic and cultural place of architecture in society.

ARTH 292N: Witches and Witchcraft from the Middle Ages to the Present,"This course will explore the social and cultural history of witches and witchcraft from the late Middle ages in Europe and the U.S. to the present. The very nature and broad scope of the topic lends itself to an interdisciplinary approach that combines history, folklore, religious studies, criminology, women's studies, art history, English literature and popular culture. Historically, real individuals were accused of witchcraft and suffered persecution and punishment accordingly. Others proclaimed themselves to be witches and the practice continues to attract adherents today such as in the modern Wiccan movement. However, modern consensus views witches as ﬁctions: ﬁgures of magical power in folklore, literature, visual art and popular culture. From Shakespeare's Macbeth to the characters in the popular Harry Potter books and ﬁlms, ﬁctional witches have haunted European and American culture for centuries. This course will explore the complex interplay of fact and ﬁction in the history of witches and witchcraft. In other words, how do ﬁctions become powerful enough to inform history? The course will also focus on the historical status of witches as a source of power outside of, andin opposition to, established political, religious and social structures. Since those accused of witchcraft were predominately women, how has witchcraft functioned as a means of empowerment for women as well as a tool for their persecution? And how has the representation of witches influenced attitudes towards women both historically and today? The course will begin with an historical inquiry into the belief in witchcraft during the late Middle Ages in Europe and the social and cultural role witches played in society. We will look at texts such as the Malleus Maleﬁcarum (Hammer of Witches) published in 1486 as a guide for hunting and destroying witches, as well as studies on the more constructive role witchcraft may have offered women and communities. The course will be organized chronologically and move back and forth between history, such as the Salem witch trials, and the representations of that history in art, literature and ﬁlm. Particular emphasis will be placed on the visual arts, from the engravings of German Renaissance artists such as Albrecht Durer and Hans Baldung Grien, the gothic paintings of Francisco Goya during the Romantic period, to contemporary artist Louise Bourgeois' monument to those executed as witches in Norway. The course will end with analysis of images of witches in popular culture, movies and television, and with a discussion of the modern representations of the domesticated witch and the femme fatale.

"ASIA 182: Asian Trade: Economy, Industrialization and Capitalism in Asia","An historical overview of economy, industrialization, globalization and capitalism in Asia from the 16th century to present. ASIA (HIST) 182 Asian Trade: Economy, Industrialization and Capitalism in Asia (3) (GH;IL) (BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. Asian economies have experienced spectacular growth in the second half of the 20th century. But this growth is part of a longer story of Asian commerce and trade and its relationship to and integration with (and, in some cases, isolation from) global patterns of exchange. Moreover, these exchanges are best understood alongside the politics, society, and culture--sometimes local, sometimes regional--that shaped trade and business in entrepots, capitals, and hinterlands throughout Asia. This course begins with a historical exploration of the economic development and social change and ends by asking what lies in store for one of the world&rsquo;s fastest growing economic regions. By offering a historical frame for Asian economic experience , students will gain insight into the strengths and weaknesses of prevailing theories that tend to overstate centralized control, market mechanisms, and cultural determination. Asian economies and markets are quite diverse, consisting of emerging and mature markets, making it difﬁcult to view them through a single lens. As a result this course seeks to introduce students to a variety of conceptual frameworks in these countries. Examinations of the major economic players China, India, and Japan form the backbone of the course, but the precise geographic emphasis will vary with instructor, and may also include discussions of Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Indonesia, Taiwan, and other Asian states. Themes of the course will vary depending on instructor, but may include industrialization, sustainability and the environment, gender and labor, protest and political reform, and consumerism and advertising, among others. The course will also offer a general introduction to economic theories that underpin the concepts of globalization, capitalism, and socialism as they are understood in an Asian context. This course is intended as an introduction to Asia for those with particular interests in Business, Economics, Global Studies, Labor, and/or Government. Through weekly readings, ﬁlms and class discussion students will be introduced to the development of Asian economies in the global context.

ASTRO 120: The Big Bang Universe,"Exploration of Cosmology, Birth, and Ultimate Fate of the Universe; Origin of Galaxies, Quasars, and Dark Matter. For non-science majors ASTRO 120 The Big Bang Universe (3) (GN)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. Astronomical observations made during the last 70 years, combined with mathematical physical theory (Einstein's General Relativity), has led to a dramatic new view of the history of the Universe. Ten to twenty billion years ago, all the material that is now contained in stars, planets, and galaxies was then compressed into a region, smaller than a pinhead, and so hot that atoms could not survive. This ﬁery cauldron cooled and expanded, forming hydrogen and helium, and eventually all the materials and structures that we know today. This course will discuss the evidence, theories and controversies of this new scientiﬁc cosmology, commonly known as 'the Big Bang'. This class is designed for the non-science students who, after learning the fundamentals of astronomy in ASTRO 1(GN), ASTRO 5 (GN) or ASTRO 10 (GN), want to pursue further the questions of cosmology. The great success of the Big Bang theory in explaining the expansion of the Universe, the synthesis of the chemical elements, and the relic radiation leftover from the ﬁrst moments are reviewed. Some of the questions discussed are still debated in the scientiﬁc community. For example: Why do some galaxies have stunning spiral structures, while others are relatively featureless ellipticals? What is the ""dark matter"" that may have emerged from the Big Bang, and seems to make a largercontribution to the mass of the universe than all of the material we are familiar with? What can the most distant and oldest objects we know of, the quasars, tell us about how galaxies formed? In presenting the development of this subject, the empirical and conceptual methods of modern physical science are conveyed. Students are assigned problems that exercise the use of elementary mathematics and physics to address real issues, and will confront discussions of interpretation and meaning in essays. A ﬁnal project allows them to explore individual interests.

BISC 3: Environmental Science,"We are living in extraordinary times. Our numbers have now become so large, our power so great, and our consumption so rampant that we are despoiling our home. Indeed, over the past half-century environmental scientists have been calling attention to the deterioration of Earth's atmosphere, Earth's oceans, Earth's forests and Earth's soils, along with the loss of Earth's biodiversity, from the tropics to the poles. The evidence is unequivocal: Planet Earth is under duress. Though we need Earth for our survival, Earth does not need us! So, will Earth shake us into oblivion or will we wake up, before it is too late, and become respectful members of Earth's community of life? This is a critical question for humankind as a whole; and it is the reason that BISC 3 exists at Penn State.

CHE 432: Petroleum Processing,"Transportation of people and goods in many parts of the world depend almost completely on petroleum fuels, such as gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel, and marine fuel. Apart from the fuels, materials that are necessary for operating the combustion engines of cars, trucks, planes, and trains also come from petroleum. These materials include lubricating oils (motor oils), greases, tires on the wheels of the vehicles, and asphalt to pave the roads for smooth rides in transportation vehicles. All petroleum fuels and many materials are produced by processing of crude oil in petroleum reﬁneries. Petroleum reﬁneries also supply feedstock to the petrochemicals and chemical industry for producing all consumer goods from rubber and plastics (polymers) to cosmetics and medicine. This course explains how physical processes and chemical reactions that take place in separate petroleum reﬁnery units are integrated to convert crude oil into desired fuels and materials. Reﬁnery processes are divided into four types that include separation, conversion, ﬁnishing, and support.The overall objective of petroleum reﬁning is to convert crude oil into fuels and materials that comply with commercial speciﬁcations and environmental regulations. All reﬁning processes and reﬁnery operations are also subjected to the applicable environmental regulations. A historical evolution of process concepts is introduced to demonstrate how the reﬁning efﬁciency has increased with signiﬁcant reduction of pollutant emissions from individual reﬁnery processes.

CHE 444: Chemical Game Theory,"""Chemical Game Theory"" (CGT), uses well-known, rigorous principles from Chemistry and Chemical Engineering to solve strategic decision problems that could be analyzed using Traditional Game Theory (TGT). In strategic decisions, players each can choose from among two or more alternative possibilities, and the outcome depends upon the collective choices from all players. In this course we will analyze some of the premises of TGT as compared with CGT. In CGT, the players' choices are treated as metaphorical molecules, and outcomes are calculated according to chemical reaction methods. The important concept of entropic choices is introduced, and pre-bias effects are included naturally as initial concentrations of reactants. CGT is not a generalization of TGT; rather, it represents contested decision problems differently, and gives different solutions. In this article we use the formalism of Chemistry to provide a ""knowlecular approach"" to analyzing contested decisions. This approach has a rich capacity to represent decision-making scenarios and serve as a decision-making algorithm for contested decisions, where leadership power plays an important role.

Successful crisis management begins before a crisis occurs. It is the responsibility of crisis management specialists to see the crisis coming and move to minimize the impact or even relegate the impending crisis to a problem. It is far better to be proactive than reactive. Having a crisis management plan is important, but avoiding a crisis by identifying its weaknesses; identifying the resources the company can use before, during and after a crisis; identifying any perceived threats that can turn into a crisis, and identifying the things that company does well in a crisis can go a long way toward negating long-term negative effects of a crisis.

It is easy to feel overwhelmed by such problems, as if little can be done. Yet there are ways to work proactively and effectively on such problems, 'living your solutions locally.' This discussion-based interdomain honors course explores how people are addressing Wicked Problems, examining the 'Right Thing to Do' from several dimensions, including (1) what is ethically appropriate to do in response to a Wicked Problem (and how perspectives on this vary); and (2) the social and behavioral means people use to address such problems. In the course students explore the complex nature of Wicked Problems, including how these are shaped by social, political, and other factors. The rules matter. Students then learn major concepts of justice which commonly are applied to such issues, how these views vary across people affected by the problem, and the importance of recognizing other peoples' perspectives. Students use case studies to explore and critique strategies for engaging Wicked Problems, and how these are used by people working to address these issues. Finally, students work together in small learning teams to analyze a Wicked Problem of their choice, including how various stakeholders view the problem and its potential solutions, and how practitioners are addressing the problem through social and behavior means.

"CED 155: Science, Technology and Public Policy","The overarching course objective is for students to understand the roles of science and technology in sustainable development, including public policy formation and implementation. The course consists of three parts. Part 1 is an introduction to how science has become such a powerful form of knowledge and how it informs public policy. The role of politics, skeptical scientists, media, and citizens on the science-policy interface are discussed as well. Part II deals in depth with theoretical concepts explaining the complex relationship between science, technology, and public policy. In part III we will discuss how researchers, policymakers and the 'public' can nevertheless work together to ﬁnd solutions to actual sustainability problems. It is expected that after completing this course, students can critically review the factors which shape and constrain the use of science and policy in addressing pressing issues in their ﬁeld of interest in an academic fashion.

CED 252: Anti-Racist Theory and Practice in Community Work,"The career path for many students in the CED program will position them to work in neighborhoods and communities where people come from a diversity of backgrounds, often different from the students¿ own background. Without proper training in histories of racism and marginalization as well as how those practices continue today, students are likely to perpetuate those harms within the communities they intend to serve. This course addresses issues of race, racism, and privilege, helping students develop a critical lens on community development through exploring questions such as ""who is developed and by whom?"":, ""who has decision making power in the community development world?"" and ""what does sustainability mean, and whose experience or knowledge counts in working to build more sustainable futures?'' The broad theme of social justice is explored by critically analyzing current trends and ethical issues and their implications. Additional focus is directed towards how structural and institutional conditions affect the opportunities and well- being of different populations (advantaged and disadvantaged groups) in society. While this course is primarily focused on the US context, there is also discussion of international issues, especially how race and racism impact media coverage and societal responses to world events impacting different groups. Students will have the opportunity to learn about and engage with community development issues related to race, racism, oppression, and privilege in State College and/or in their home communities through different course assignments. After taking this course, students should feel better equipped to deploy an equity lens in their educational and community-based experiences and practices. The learning objectives and themes of this course are reinforced throughout upper level CED courses so students are able to carry this knowledge and skills into their future professional lives.

CED 329H: Intermediate Environmental & Resource Economics (Honors),"This Honors course focuses on intermediate principles of environmental and natural resource economics, with strong emphasis on policy analysis and applications. The central focus in any economics course is how best to allocate scarce resources and this holds true for this course as well. However, in this course the goods and services we will talk about differ from those in other economics courses in that there is typically no market in which to trade them - e.g., air and water quality or a scenic view. Thus, it may be the case that government policies are needed to maintain and enhance their quantity and/or quality. The course is structured around a number of broad thematic areas with individual book chapters, papers, Undergraduate - The Pennsylvania State University 2024-2025 3685 class discussions, and assignments used to learn the material. The ﬁrst two parts provide a review of micro and environmental economic theory, and an overview of how economists think about environmental issues.

"CED 375: Community, Local Knowledge, and Democracy","Understanding community decision-making, citizen-expert interactions and methods for resolving seemingly intractable conflicts associated with public issues. CED 375H Community, Local Knowledge, and Democracy (3) Decisions made in our communities have far reaching effects on individuals, families, neighborhoods, the local economy, the environment, the health and welfare of all citizens, and the community as a whole. These decisions or choices are the result of the collective action of community leaders and citizens, either through governmental, non- governmental, or community organizations. This course will familiarize students with principles, concepts and skills essential to understanding processes of community decision making and community development. These processes involve countless human interactions, which ultimately lead to choices that affect the future economic, environmental, political, and social viability of citizens, their families, and the sustainability of their communities. These interactions are central to community decision making and community development, and to the functioning of local democracy. The nature of these interactions and the way in which they take place determine if desired community outcomes occur or not. This course seeks to reveal important, sometimes neglected or underdeveloped, factors in community decision making, speciﬁcally issue framing, tensions between local and expert knowledge, methods for resolving seemingly intractable conflicts associated with public issues, and the nature and role of participatory processes in debate, deliberation,and doing public work. This course will enable students to use these factors for analyzing community decision making situations and as community development tools in professional practice. In addition, students will be challenged to examine ethical issues in community decision making and community development professional practice.

CED 400N: Exploring Indigenous Ways of Knowing in Great Lakes Region:,"Exploring Indigenous Ways of Knowing in the Great Lakes Region explores concepts and values distinctive to indigenous ways of knowing (IK) in the Great Lakes Region through readings, video segments, and lectures. Five structural concepts or key themes - local knowledge, relational knowledge, empirical knowledge, spiritual knowledge, and traditional knowledge - provide a conceptual framework for understanding indigenous cultures and knowledge production and their unique contributions to western society in the 21st century. Students will be introduced to the Algonquian cultures of the Great Lakes Region and to the Ojibwe (Anishinaabeg), Odawa, and Potawatomi (Three Fires) cultures in particular. This course will introduce students to the distinctive ways indigenous people experience, understand, and know the world through their relationship with the land or region to which they belong. Too often, colonizers around the world have ignored indigenous knowledge systems even though these ways of knowing have sustained peoples, cultures, and environments for thousands of generations. Because these ways of knowing are generally preserved and transmitted through stories, music, ceremony, and embodied traditions, they are seldom understood and frequently dismissed by those who control the production of knowledge in the modern world. The knowledge of the indigenous peoples of the Great Lakes region will, in this course, be presented as an empirically grounded scientiﬁc body of knowledge and theory comparable and complementary to the European tradition and, in speciﬁc ways, enhancing the sustainability of western scientiﬁc knowledge and practice. This course is a prerequisite for the Maymester ﬁeld experience - Exploring Indigenous Ways of Knowing among the Ojibwe CED 401 which offers students an opportunity to experience indigenous ways of knowing by engaging with Ojibwe educators, traditional knowledge holders, elders, and families in several of the three largest Ojibwe reservations in the US.

"CED 460W: Policy, Politics and Perspectives on Social & Environmental","Social and environmental responsibility often is viewed very differently by various stakeholders, such as consumers, investors, businesses, labor government, and others. The elements and issues they consider as important elements within social and environmental justice, and how they weight each element, can vary signiﬁcantly across stakeholders. The terminology used to describe this work similarly differs (i.e. sustainability, social responsibility, corporate citizenship, corporate social responsibility, etc.), which can lead to misunderstandings. This course examines the differing perspectives that consumers, investors, businesses, labor, government, and others have towards social and environmental responsibility, and the differing roles that each stakeholder plays. Such roles can range from individual choices about what to purchase and consume, where to invest, and where to work, to collective and organizational choices, such as about what services or products to offer, how these are produced, and where/how supplies are obtained. The course uses institutional and behavioral economic concepts of the interdependent nature of the market, as a theoretical framework for understanding the interdependence of various stakeholders' opportunities and decisions, and the influence of the public policy.

CMPET 211: Embedded Processors and DSP,"Introduction to micro-controllers and embedded controllers with applications, including concepts of digital signal processing. CMPET 211 Embedded Processors and DSP (3)CMPET 211 provides students with a basic understanding of microprocessors and microcontrollers with an emphasis on integrated embedded control of real world applications. The course provides a background in micro-processor/controller architecture, presents the operation and application of microcontroller peripherals, and introduces assembly language and higher level structured programming language. This can be a structured language such as C++ or PIC Basic. The intent is to introduce the students to a more powerful programming language capable of developing algorithms for embedded control of real world processes. Students will learn the analog to digital (ADC) and digital to analog (DAC) process and understand the resolution and aliasing consequences of these conversions. With the ADC and DAC material mastered, the course will then introduce students to basic applications of Digital Signal Processing (DSP), such as digital ﬁltering and noise reduction. Simple discrete Fourier transforms can be covered along with sampling theory and digital aliasing. Although some of the mathematical theory underlying DSP techniques, such as Fourier and Hilbert Transforms, digital ﬁlter design and signal compression, can be fairly complex, the numerical operations required to actually implement these techniques are relatively simple and will be shown. DSP chips and applications will be covered to illustrate how to carry out such operations incredibly fast and efﬁciently. Topics covered include:- Microprocessor, microcontroller, and embedded system architecture- Microcontroller peripherals- Assembly Language Syntax and Programming- Structured Programming and Algorithms- Input and Output interfacing- ADC and DAC conversions- Sampling and DSP The course will emphasize the concepts, principles, procedures, and programming models used by engineers and technologists to design, develop and implement digital control for real world instrumentation. Particular emphasis will be given to embedded controllers for process control. Lectures will be supported by laboratory exercises in which the student will develop, assemble, download, and run programs on the target processor.

The nature of physical evidence is emphasized along with limitations that technology and knowledge impose on its individualization and characterization. Particular attention is paid to the meaning and roleof probability in interpreting the individual signiﬁcance of scientiﬁcally evaluated evidence. Major, lecture topics include the following: The Crime Scene; Physical Evidence; Physical Properties of Glass, Soil, and Plastics; Organic Analysis; Inorganic Analysis; the Microscope; Hairs, Fibers, and Paints; Drugs; Forensic Toxicology; Forensic Aspects of Arson and Explosion Investigation; Forensic Serology; Forensic Anthropology; DNA; Finger Prints; Fire Arms; Tool Marks and Other Impressions; Document and Voice Examination; and Forensic Science on the Internet. To understand the techniques used in crime scene analysis hands-on activities as formal experiments in the laboratory setting form part of the course. The speciﬁc objectives of the laboratory components of the courses are: 1) To provide a ﬁrst set of laboratory experiments for criminal justice and general science students who have had little or no previous science laboratory experience. 2) To show beginning students in criminal justice and general science the signiﬁcance of physical evidence at the scene of a crime. 3) To demonstrate what happens to physical evidence when it is sent to the laboratory so that students will know what is needed, how much is needed, and how to prepare 4) To educate the student in basic laboratory practices so that they can ask and/or answer questions more intelligently in a court of law. And probably most important, to educate students so that they will not unintentionally destroy physical evidence at a crime scene, and will in fact try to preserve it for the trained forensic scientist. The experiments are designed to provide students with an overview of what can be done as a prelude to making them potential professional forensic scientists/ criminologists. The proposed courses are meant for students majoring in the Administration of Justice Programs and should augment their knowledge of criminology and reinforce approaches utilized by law enforcement scientists. Students will carry out hands on experiments in biology, chemistry and physics in a dedicated laboratory setting. Use of instrument to analyze specimens and gather/interpret data using computers and statistical techniques form part of the course. Students will be graded based on their understanding of the principles involved in selecting and using speciﬁc laboratory techniques and on the quality of results of their laboratory experience.

First, the course studies the jurisdictions of the various courts and their organization in various state systems as well as the federal courts as well as the organization of state and federal administrative ofﬁces that manage the courts including the training of judges and the preparation of the court budget. Subsequent to the development of the basic understanding of the court jurisdiction and organization, the class studies the roles of the key actors in the day-in and day-out operation of the courts. In the spotlight are judges, prosecutors and defense attorneys although the role of the probation ofﬁcers and clerk of courts are also intertwined with the processing of defendants. Of particular importance in this component of the course is the development of what is referred to as the court community and the focal concerns and goals that the court must consider as it processes cases. An, understanding of court community and focal concerns serves as crucial context for understanding the role of public policy as it attempts to shift or change the decision making of the court. One important dynamic of this course is the understanding that the court, although functioning as an institution to provide a neutral ﬁeld on which accusations of criminality are to be played out, operates similarly to other organizations in that they are to be efﬁcient (move cases with minimum overhead) and to be effective (provide justice, and protect the public). How the courts balance these competing demands and the informal processes that emerge in the processing of defendants is the key focus of the class.

"CI 304N: Food, Farms & Justice: What's Education Got To Do With Them?","This course intends to unite students' minds, hearts, and bodies in an historical, sociological, and experiential exploration of food and farms and their educational possibilities. Students' minds will be engaged as they explore the 20th century history, contributions, and legacy of industrial agriculture and the emergence of alternative approaches related to food and farming in recent decades. Students' hearts will be engaged as they consider their own relationship to food, to soil and place, and to learning. Finally, students' bodies will be engaged as they directly participate in farming/gardening and communal meal preparation and enjoyment. The uniting of mind, heart and body culminates as students become teachers - applying their embodied knowledge in the creation of learning activities that are taught to others. Guiding questions for students' explorations include: (1) How is food - its cultivation, preparation and enjoyment - a cultural, ecological and moral activity? and (2) How might farm/garden based education cultivate abiding relationships between people and their places/communities, their soils, their bodies, and to more just and humane relationships to others? In the ﬁrst half of the course, students will be introduced to influential writers representing diverse perspectives within the humanities.The aim is that students conduct a reckoning of industrial, large-scale and corporate orientations to agriculture. Why? To discern desirable alternatives that promote the health and well-being of people, soils, and communities. Students will discern a vision of a just, sustainable and meaningful life. In the second half of the course, students apply their understandings of food, farm, justice and sustainability to developing farm/garden based learning experiences for others. To this end students will be introduced to farm/garden based education; constructivist, student-centered learning theories; curriculum development approaches; and the design of performance assessments. Finally, having studied instructional/curricular theory and practice, students will apply their learning through a ""ﬁeld- based"" teaching practicum, showcasing their skills in developing farm/ garden based curriculum and instruction.

EM SC 100S Earth and Mineral Sciences First-Year Seminar (3) (GWS;FYS) The EMS First- Year Seminar is designed to encourage students to begin the important process of 'thinking for a living.' The primary focus of the seminar is to promote critical reading and thinking skills, and to help students develop effective written and oral arguments. Students learn the importance of reading, sharing ideas and collaborating, through independent and groupresearch, discussion and debate. We want our students to think about some of the major issues facing the world today, the role that science and technology have played in deﬁning and addressing these issues, the way in which present-day thinking has been shaped by the past, and the development of scientiﬁc thought. The Seminar's content focuses on communication skills, but these are addressed within the context of issues relevant to the disciplines represented in EMS. As such, the discussions range across topics such as the Earth and its resources; scientiﬁc and technical aspects of global habitability; development of the advanced materials necessary for sustaining and advancing civilization in the 21st century; and the social, economic, and political factors that shape and constrain society's view of the Earth system. Students undertake three to ﬁve major writing projects throughout the semester, as well as several smaller one to two paragraph written assignments.

EMSC 101: Resource Wars,"""Resource Wars"" presents an analysis of natural resources and how competition for them shapes national and international cultures and geopolitics. EM SC 101 Resource Wars (3) (US;IL) The faculty of the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences are uniquely qualiﬁed to teach ""Resource Wars"", a course that presents an analysis of natural resources and how competition for them shapes contemporary and historical culture and geopolitics. ""Resource wars"" will examine the extent to which the Gulf War of 1991, the explosive conflict between the United States and Islamic extremists, and present engagement in Iraq are manifestations of a foreign policy that comes from a desire for resource security. While the current Iraq war is the most recent manifestation of the clash between US and IL cultures, there are many examples of past resource wars in world history. Although the present conflict in the Middle East is about petroleum, past conflicts involve the entire spectrum of natural resources from gold and diamonds to rubber and tea to water, clean air, and living space. Class discussion will meld the technical aspects of discovery and extraction with its impact on society from a cultural and geopolitical points of view (US & IL).Technical analysis starts with the geology of the natural resource. The extraction, harnessing, or mining of that natural resource and resource transportation come next. The use of that natural resource as a material follows. Of course, short term and long climatic instability may play roles. The human elements (US & IL) involved in the trading and development of the resource lead to both armed interstate conflicts and intrastate disputes. Cultural questions might include how the digital age impact resource control and trade, how global resource distribution impacts energy security and utilization, and how international resource competition impacts the climate. Ultimately, the class is led to an understanding about how scarcity has impacted cultures throughout human history (US & IL).The tentative plan is that each lecture period consists of two parts starting with a moderator (the lead faculty member throughout the entire semester) who summarizes the resource under discussion in a 10-15 minute introduction. Then, appropriate EMS faculty will offer detailed accounts of their particular expertise. This format requires two 75-minute classes per week (30 per semester).The moderator shall be responsible Undergraduate - The Pennsylvania State University 2024-2025 3783 for grading the class including the discussion and written responses in a large classroom format (50+ students) taught in one lecture hall.

EARTH 109: The Fundamentals of Shale Energy Development,"Energy is a critical component of modern society, yet we face signiﬁcant challenges associated with balancing energy demands, energy security, environmental sustainability, and stable economics with sound regulations and policy. Unconventional energy development from shale formations has been a game changer for the fossil fuel industry over the past decade and is projected to continue to grow over the next several decades. But there are still many uncertainties on how to optimally develop these largely untapped resources to maximize the social beneﬁts while minimizing environmental impacts. This course covers key topics needed to provide students with an overview of the science, engineering, environmental impacts, geopolitics, economics and societal impacts of shale energy development. These topics include geology, resource assessment, drilling technology, hydraulic fracturing methods, 3788 Earth Sciences (EARTH) environmental impacts, economics, workforce needs, infrastructure, utilization trends, regulation, energy policy, energy exports, international geopolitics, societal considerations, and the future of unconventional energy and its relationship with other energy forms. The class is geared toward a broad audience of students to provide a big picture view of the shale energy landscape. The course is structured in four parts. The course begins with the geology of shale (part 1), then examines engineering and environmental aspects of shale energy production (part 2), then explores relevant economic, geopolitical and societal issues (part 3) and ends with a capstone project (part 4). Shale energy development in a key U.S. shale basin is used in parts 1 -3 to provide examples and illustrate concepts, impacts and problems. In the capstone project, students will learn about the shale energy development in another basin of their choosing and present their ﬁndings to the class, thereby developing further the students' understanding of the core course content while gaining an overview of shale energy development beyond the U.S. shale basin presented in the course.

EARTH 111N: Water: Science and Society,"The Earth is often called ""The Blue Planet"", a reference to the fact that over two-thirds of its surface is covered by water. Despite its apparent abundance, water is a valuable and limited resource; less than 2.5% of the water on the planet is fresh, and only one third of that is potable. The small fraction of Earth¿s water that is useable to humans is distributed very unevenly. As a result, conflicts over water occur from the local level, for example: pitting rancher against developer - to the global level, at which nations square off against one-another in war and use water as a mechanism for imposing sanctions. The dire situation in some regions has spurred numerous research and technological endeavors, such as water desalinization, genetic engineering of crops, and major overhauls of agricultural practice. In this course, we explore the relationships between water and human populations, with emphasis on water resources and quality in the Western U.S., and how these have shaped history and modern politics. We will focus ﬁrst on developing the scientiﬁc underpinnings of water¿s unique properties, behavior, movement, occurrence, and quality. With this background, we will then discuss key issues relating to modern and historical conflicts, human impacts on the natural world, and human engineering accomplishments driven by our thirst for this valuable resource. We will discuss historical examples from the American West, speciﬁcally the development of water resources in Arizona, Colorado and California. We will also explore modern and historical conflicts between stakeholders. Major themes will include political and economic conflicts over (1) water resources - for example, balancing agricultural and urban demands in the American west in the Denver and Los Angeles metropolitan areas, (2) water quality - for example, considering the impact of economically proﬁtable human activities on water quality and transmission of disease, and (3) human impacts on natural processes, speciﬁcally connecting human activity with our cultural history of water use and exploration in the American West.

EE 413: Power Electronics,"Switch-mode electrical power converters. Electrical characteristics and thermal limits of semiconductor switches. E E 413 Power Electronics (3) E E 413 is an elective course taken by undergraduate and graduate electrical engineering students. The objective of E E 413 is to introduce techniques for the analysis, design, and application of the switch- mode power converters that are used in power supplies, motor andactuator drives, and the interface between power distribution systems and emerging energy sources such as fuel cells, photovoltaics, and superconducting magnetic energy storage systems. Several laboratory experiments provide an opportunity to characterize the switching behavior of semiconductor devices, build and test various dc/dc and ac/ dc converters, and consider alternatives for gate/base drive and feedback isolation circuits required to build practical converters.This course draws upon the students' background in time-domain circuit analysis, electronic devices and circuits, Fourier analysis, and use of software such as PSPICE and MATLAB. It does not require a background in power or electric machinery, although students with such a background will be able to appreciate many of the applications more fully.The course is divided into four major areas: rectiﬁers and phase-controlled converters, dc-to-dc converters, inverters, and design considerations for practical converters. The focus in each of the ﬁrst three areas is to determine the relationship between the magnitude of the fundamental frequency component and/ or average value of the voltages and currents at the two ports of the particular converter. Additional harmonic or ripple components are then considered and design guidelines for the switching and reactive components are derived. The fourth area encompasses the study of power device characteristics, the design of gate drive and feedback circuits, and the analysis/design of elementary controllers.As the name implies, students interested in either electronics or power will ﬁnd this course worthwhile. Electronics students will gain a new perspective on the operation and analysis of electronic circuits as well as an opportunity to discover what has powered the circuits that they have studied up until this course.

EE 481: Control Systems,"Classical/modern approaches to system analysis/design; time/frequency domain modeling, stability, response, optimization, and compensation. E E 481 Control Systems (4) This course presents both classical and modern approaches to the modeling, analysis and control system design for continuous time systems. Students learn how to model both mechanical and electrical systems in the time and frequency domains using differential equations, transfer functions, state space methods and frequency domain (Bode) techniques. The goal of developing linear system models is to facilitate system analysis and control design. Modeling is followed by an in-depth study of systems analysis, including stability, transient response and steady state characteristics. The study of stability involves examining the effects of pole and zero placement, and the Routh criterion is used extensively. In the consideration of transient response characteristics, students investigate rise time, peaktime, overshoot, and settling time. The primary steady state feature studied is the error between the reference signal input and the system output, and students learn to characterize steady state error through the determination of system type and computation of the error constants. Design of control systems focuses on altering one or more of the system characteristics by adding compensation. Students employ a variety of root locus techniques, proportional-plus integral-plus-derivative (PID), state feedback, and frequency response methods. Students begin with simple proportional, closed-loop control and examine pole migration through root locus plots. They then learn to apply more robust pole placement techniques using proportional and derivated (PD) control. Next, PID controllers are examined with a number of opportunities for design. After learning the classical control techniques, students then concentrate on state feedback control methods, including the design of partial- and full-order observers. Finally, students learn the relationship between time domain analysis and design and frequency domain (Bode) analysis of both magnitude and phase. This course includes a laboratory in which students use MATLAB and Simulink for modeling, analysis and control system design. A minimum of seven laboratory exercises offer students the opportunity to experiment with nearly every concept in a powerful simulation environment.

ENGR 451: Social Entrepreneurship,"Students develop business models and implementation strategies for social ventures in diverse world regions. ENGR 451 Social Entrepreneurship (3) Social Entrepreneurship is about pursuing direct action to address a social problem in a manner that leads to a truly sustainable solution. A similar perspective on social entrepreneurship is based on Jean-Baptiste's deﬁnition of entrepreneurs as permanent value creators. If the primary objective of value creation is positive social change, then the entrepreneur can be categorized as a social entrepreneur. Sustainability and scalability of the venture to create social change on a larger scale is essential. Metaphorically, while conventional entrepreneurs might pursue the creation of multi-million dollar enterprises, social entrepreneurs strive to create multi-million smile enterprises, while understanding that their ability to expand their social returns bears a dynamic interdependence with their economic bottom line. The mission of the venture must be strongly aligned with the measured outcomes, and this emphasis on measuring social and economic impact is crucial to the efﬁcacy and success of social enterprises.The theory and praxis of social entrepreneurship is constantly evolving within the complex framework of political, economic and social changes occurring at the global, national and local levels in the US and other countries. Students study the dynamics of social challenges, approaches to address them, and the conceptual framework of social innovation and social entrepreneurship from theoretical and practical perspectives. Students explore technology solutions to addressing global social problems with a systems thinking approach. Case studies of successful and failed social ventures from diverse world regions and ﬁelds like healthcare, energy, food and agriculture, education, income generation, and access to capital are employed.

ENGL 467: African American Novel II,"This course examines the African American novel, its forms, and its traditions starting during the Harlem Renaissance. It follows the genre's evolution into the twenty-ﬁrst century, outlining the relationships among the texts that form the body of African American narrative as well as the relationships of those texts to the constantly shifting cultural and political realities surrounding their writing. From the Renaissance heralded by Alain Locke, through the Civil Rights and Black Power Movements -and their attendant Black Arts Movement- and into the era of the Movement for Black Lives, course readings encompass a broad range of styles and genres, from realism, naturalism, and naturalist primitivism, through the experimental forms, magical realism, and ""postrace aesthetics"" of later times. The course invites students to think critically about the African American novel as a socially and politically engaged form, and to identify and analyze the long tradition of resistance that variously informs its development. Authors covered in the course might include major ﬁgures such as Claude McKay, Zora Neale Hurston, Nella Larsen, Wallace Thurman, Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, Ann Petry, James Baldwin, Ishmael Reed, Earnest Gaines, Alice Walker, Toni Morrison, Toni Cade Bambara, Octavia Butler, Gayle Jones, Samuel Delany, Charles Johnson, John Edgar Wideman, Colson Whitehead, and others. Still, the course gives due attention to lesser known/studied materials from the period, including graphic novels, satire, speculative ﬁction, performance novels, and various other experimental forms. Course readings and instruction give particular attention to how African American novels of the twentieth and twenty-ﬁrst centuries variously engage social identity categories, like race, gender, class, and sexuality, and how they engage and resist various literary conventions associated with naturalism, modernism, and postmodernism. The course also traces the development of new thematic and aesthetic interests in a generation of writers whose ﬁction has been influenced by the explosion of interest in the graphic novel, the popularity of cultural forms such as hip hop, and the ascendancy of the digital age. Scholarly readings accompany primary texts to give students a sense of the critical work that has gone into and continues to go on in the study of African American literature. In this course, students learn how to analyze literature, do close and careful readings of texts, conduct related research, and write persuasively about literary works.

ENGL 478: Grant Writing,"Grants can do many things. Let's say you are a student who has always dreamed of combining help for food-insecure people with support for the mentally ill homeless. You've written papers about it for classes; you've read lots of research that points to past pitfalls and future innovative possibilities--but now you want to make it real by ﬁnding funding for the program you've envisioned. Or maybe you have your sights set on ﬁnding an existing non-proﬁt foundation that might serve as a ﬁscal conduit for grants that will feed the cause you feel passionately about. Thesescenarios and many others call for ﬁnding and winning a grant. Here's what grants can't do: Write themselves. Given that writers of grants do not have one how-to professional manual to rely on, professional grant- seekers must learn to have flexible responses to a variety of writing situations. Every grant proposal is different, as is every population with a problem to solve, and every organization hoping to help with the solution.

FOR 410: Elements of Forest Ecosystem Management,"Changing public attitudes towards the environment during the last several decades have led to a philosophical shift in how we manage our forests. The primary focus of a sound stewardship of many of our public forests has now shifted to the recognition that sustaining ecological integrity of forest ecosystems, including the maintenance and restoration of native biological diversity, may be more important than focusing primarily on commodity production. Ecosystem management has become policy on national forests managed by the U.S. Forest Service and Pennsylvania state forests managed by the Pennsylvania Department of Natural Resources. This course invites students to critically examine the concept of ecosystem management from an ecological, economic, and social perspective, Students will review the evolution of ecosystem management and learn how it is being implemented. Basic questions addressed in this course include: What is ecosystem management? How can concepts such as biodiversity preservation, ecosystem integrity, sustainability, and forest health be achieved in forested landscapes? How can human needs be balanced with ecological goals? How can competing societal goals be balanced? This course is designed for forestry majors and places contemporary management approaches into the larger ecosystem context that uses knowledge of forest history, landscape ecology, conservation biology, forest restoration, and forest certiﬁcation requirements to develop management solutions that pay particular attention to the maintenance of biodiversity (habitat) and soils.

FOR 442: Forest Conservation: Principles and Practices,"Forest conservation is the promotion and maintenance of healthy, resilient, and functioning forest ecosystems that ensure the continued provision of high-quality ecosystem services and socio-economic beneﬁts. To achieve desired conservation outcomes, on-the-ground forest practices must comply with minimum standards detailed in regulatory and/or voluntary management guidelines (i.e., Best Management Practices, BMPs) to not be harmful to the environment or local people. Further, many private and public forest management entities follow voluntary global and national third-party forest certiﬁcation schemes that promote environmentally responsible management of the world's forests. Compliance with certiﬁcation standards is evaluated through annual ﬁeld audits as the central element to verify that forest operations meet sustainability criteria. Because timber harvesting now constitutes the predominant disturbance regime in northeastern forests, poorly planned, 3980 Forestry (FOR) timed, and executed logging operations constitute the most serious threat to forest conservation and sustainability in managed forests and thus receive particular scrutiny in ﬁeld audits. Foresters must therefore ensure that forest practices do not injure advance tree regeneration and ground flora, damage structural legacies such as residual trees and deadwood, reduce the potential to sequester carbon, undermine biodiversity and wildlife goals (e.g., breeding success), or adversely affect soil structure and site productivity (e.g., compaction and soil erosion), water quality, wetlands, riparian areas, visual quality, and cultural and spiritual values. This course traces the evolution of forest conservation and sustainability and introduces students to modern, low impact timber harvest systems and a variety of other forest practices intended to safeguard biodiversity, maintain the productive capacity of forests, and protect soil and water resources. Students will become familiar with BMPs and principles, criteria, and sustainability indicators of common certiﬁcation schemes.

FR 419: French Semantics,"The study of meaning in human language with a special focus on how it is encoded in French. FR 419 French Semantics (3) The aim of this course is to provide upper level undergraduate students in French with a relatively informal introduction to the ﬁeld of semantics as it applies to the French language. Semantics is the subﬁeld of theoretical linguistics that seeks to make explicit the rules native speakers use to interpret stable aspects of the meaning of natural language sentences. The course will begin by comparing and contrasting semantic and pragmatic aspects of meaning -an important undertaking since only the former are assumed to be subject to invariable rules of grammar. The conclusions reached in this portion of the course will then be extended to account for a very special type of language -humor -in a particular context, France. That as, it will be shown that a more complete understanding of this linguistic behavior entails recognition of the relative contributions of pragmatics and semantics. We will then turn to a survey of the classic model- theoretic approach to lexical and compositional aspects of semantic meaning, with important (sociolinguistic) reﬁnements to the standard approach to lexical semantics being discussed in detail. With a survey of the fundamentals of the ﬁeld in place, we will then undertake an investigation of speciﬁc topics in semantics, looking ﬁrst at the status of thematic roles in semantic theory (focusing on work by David Dowty). Here we will examine the important implications his work holds for the initial mapping of arguments into sentence structure, not only for primary transitive verbs, but also unaccusative and psych-verbs. We will then examine current analyses of causation in French, certain aspectual distinctions, and semantic, pragmatic, and syntactic approaches to negative and positive polarity items, n-words, and minimizers.

FSC 432: Petroleum Processing,"Transportation of people and goods in many parts of the world depend almost completely on petroleum fuels, such as gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel, and marine fuel. Apart from the fuels, materials that are necessary for operating the combustion engines of cars, trucks, planes, and trains also come from petroleum. These materials include lubricating oils (motor oils), greases, tires on the wheels of the vehicles, and asphalt to pave the roads for smooth rides in transportation vehicles. All petroleum fuels and many materials are produced by processing of crude oil in petroleum reﬁneries. Petroleum reﬁneries also supply feedstock to the petrochemicals and chemical industry for producing all consumer goods from rubber and plastics (polymers) to cosmetics and medicine. This course explains how physical processes and chemical reactions that take place in separate petroleum reﬁnery units are integrated to convert crude oil into desired fuels and materials. Reﬁnery processes are divided into four types that include separation, conversion, ﬁnishing, and support. The overall objective of petroleum reﬁning is to convert crude oil into fuels and materials that comply with commercial speciﬁcations and environmental regulations. All reﬁning processes and reﬁnery operations are also subjected to the applicable environmental regulations. A historical evolution of process concepts is introduced to demonstrate how the reﬁning efﬁciency has increased with signiﬁcant reduction of pollutant emissions from individual reﬁnery processes. The principal objectives of this course are to enable students to: 1. explain the market drivers for the reﬁning industry (ABET student outcome 2). 2. indicate what crude oils consist of and how crude oils are characterized based on their physical properties (ABET 1, 2); 3. express the objectives of petroleum reﬁning and classify the processes used in petroleum reﬁning(ABET 1, 2, 7); 4. demonstrate how a petroleum reﬁnery works and sketch a flow diagram that integrates all reﬁning processes and the resulting reﬁnery products (ABET 2); 5. examine how each reﬁnery process works and how physical and chemical principles are applied to achieve the objectives of each reﬁnery process (ABET 1, 2, 7); 6. assess implications of changing crude oil feedstocks on reﬁnery conﬁguration and propose strategies to resolve conflicts with degrading crude oil quality and increasingly stringent environmental regulations on petroleum fuels (ABET outcome 4, 7); 7. discuss different sources of natural gas and explain how natural gas is processed at well sites and in processing plants with application of selected reﬁnery processes and other physical operations (ABET 1, 2).

The course will provide students with the opportunity to read and learn about the ways in which humans think about, use, and are affected by the natural environment. It will also provide skills for analyzing and evaluating the ways in which humans have transformed the environment in different parts of the world through the integration of knowledge from the natural and social sciences. This class is designed to address big questions in human-environment interactions at the present time, while drawing upon their histories and key conceptual ideas. 1. What is a human-environment system? How does the geographic disciplinecontribute towards understanding human-environment systems and sustainability? 2. Why do we conserve what we conserve? Is it possible to conserve natural resources and also meet human needs? 3. What are ways to manage the effects of economic development upon the natural environment? Is sustainable development possible? 4. How is climate change impacting social and ecological systems? Can we adapt to the impacts of climate change? One of the hallmarks of the discipline of geography is attention to how social and ecological processes interact and spread across spatial scales. This means that speciﬁc events, such as the consumption of particular product or the emission of greenhouse gases, connect sites within countries and across the globe. GEOG 30N meets the deﬁnition for both a US and international cultures course by emphasizing how current human-environment systems developed over time in the U.S. and internationally.

GEOG 128: Geography of International Affairs,"Contemporary international affairs in their geographical setting; geographic elements in the development of national power, political groupings, and international disputes. GEOG 128 Geography of International Affairs (3) (GS;IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. Geography of International Affairs uses the organizing principle of geographic scale to examine the spatial patterns of and interrelationships among political processes and institutions. Particular emphasis is given to developing an integrative view of how global, national, local and individual scale processes interact to produce patterns of peace and conflict. The course analyzes how the actions of individuals, states and other political actors are influenced by their dynamic geographical contexts. The political geography approach does not simply discuss the war, peace, nationalism, terrorism, and religious organizations in isolation; instead, it concentrates on understanding the integration of these processes, and how their integration mediates political decisions and outcomes. Geography of International Affairs is concerned with the geopolitical context, broadly deﬁned - the manner in which spaces and places are combinations of the political and the social, the domestic and the international, the global and the local - and how it partially determines the form and outcomes of politics. As a course in geography, Geography of International Affairs encourages students to interpret political problems, actions, and disputes through the lens of the Six Essential Elements of Geography (National Geographic): Places and Regions; Physical Systems; Human Systems: Environment and Society; the World in Spatial Terms; and Uses of Geography. Further, this course also encourages students to examine and interpret internationalaffairs through the lens of different geopolitical theories, developed by the likes of Ratzel, Mahan, Mackinder, Spykman, Kissinger, Wallerstein, and others. In this sense, students are encouraged to adopt the role of political geographers. Political geographers have developed and adopted many tools to address these themes. Maps are obvious choices, but geographers also use a wide array of statistical and qualitative techniques to study the distribution of political processes and the processes themselves. They use geographic information systems and computer models to manipulate, display, and analyze spatial data. Geography of International Affairs acquaints students with many of these tools. When the above points are taken together, political geography emerges as a unique ﬁeld of social science. Geography of International Affairs provides a learning experience that students can get in no other discipline - one that takes an integrated view that makes contemporary international affairs relevant and understandable.

Geographic data specify the locations and characteristics of people, the objects people create, and the various phenomena of the natural environment with which people interact. Geographic data are produced by several methods, including land surveying, aerial photography and photo grammetry, satellite remote sensing and positioning systems, and social surveys such as those conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. Geographic information systems (GIS) and related technologies are used to turn data into maps, tables, and other kinds of information people need to make informed decisions. In a rapidly changing world, detailed, up-to- date geographic data are indispensable for governance, for commerce, and for research intended to improve our understanding of social and environmental systems. GEOG 160 helps students begin to develop the knowledge, skills, and dispositions that constitute geographic information literacy - the ability to 'recognize when information is needed and ... to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information' (ALA 1989). Geographic information science (GIScience) is are search enterprise concerned with the design, development, and use of geographic information technologies to help institutions and individuals not only respond to, but ideally to predict, environmental and social change. GEOG 160 is an introduction to GI Science that provides students with the technical and contextual knowledge they need to become knowledgeable consumers of geographic data and information produced by government agencies, industry, and popular media. The course is intended to be of value not only to future specialists in the geographic information enterprise, but also to every student who is concerned with social and environmental research and policy-making. Like other information technologies, GIS is evolving rapidly. People who work with GIS understand that learning is a way of life, not just a prelude to a career. With this in mind, GEOG 160 aims not only to help students 4000 Geography (GEOG) learn about geography and GIS, but also to develop the disposition to become effective lifelong learners.

A major theme in the discipline of geography is the study of the relationships between humans and the natural environment. GEOG 230 introduces students to the multiple ways in which people and the environment are interconnected. From a dynamic systems perspective, we refer to this interconnectedness as 'coupled social-ecological systems.' The course uses a geographic perspective to understand how differently these linkages are shaped in various ecological and cultural settings around the globe. The course follows an interdisciplinary approach, exploring from multiple angles major environmental and societal challenges such as climate change, genetically-modiﬁed food, over-consumption, disease, and environmental service provision in the industrialized North and the Global South. It promotes critical thinking regarding key concepts such as carrying capacity, ecological footprints, feedback, stability domains, and resilience. Students are encouraged to examine their role and responsibilities for the sustainability of the social- ecological systems we inhabit and to take action in their own lives to contribute to a more equitable and sustainable environment. The course will provide students with the opportunity to read, learn, and debate about the ways in which humans value, use, affect, and are affected by small-scale and large- scale human-environment interactions. It will provide them with skills for critically analyzing and evaluating the ways in which humans have transformed the environment in different parts of the world. They will also learn how to assess what future pathways are sustainable and ethically sound. One key goal of the course will be to help students increase their sensitivity to the global and international context of human interactions with nature. A discussion section allows students to explore controversial issues such as biotechnology, nature as a commodity, and global warming, and to develop critical positions on such issues. Through attendance of lectures, participation in discussion sections, and completion of reading and writing assignments, successful students will: -build an interdisciplinary understanding of how biophysical and social environments are intertwined and shape one another -comprehend the range and importance of different disciplinary approaches to researching human-environment systems - develop a toolkit of key concepts and theories for understanding human-environment systems and evaluating questions of sustainability - evaluate and critique different perspectives for intervening in human-environment interactions, including sustainable development, deep ecology and degrowth.",PDF,5.0,Sustainability,sustainability_and_policy-4,"{""sustainability"": 2}"

GEOG 439: Property and the Global Environment,"This course reviews theoretical and empirical relationships between multiple legal, economic, and cultural approaches to property, and environmental quality and conflicts. GEOG 439GEOG 439 Property and the Global Environment (3) Property relations are among the most powerful and pervasive institutions in human societies. Fundamental rules governing and legitimating who can do what, and where, they shape and reveal interactions between human societies and physical environments, a concern at the heart of geography. Our own property relations are often all but invisible to us precisely because they are so deeply woven into our perceptions, consciousness, social structures, and everyday experiences of the world. It is thus easy to overlook the factthat we live within highly speciﬁc and contingent property arrangements and that changing circumstances are prompting important changes in contemporary property relations.This course explores these issues with a particular focus on their implications for environmental politics and regulation. We will address questions such as: Is the privatization and commodiﬁcation of nature a recipe for ecological disaster, or the most effective means of preservation? Can we own the weather? What were the historical-geographical circumstances surrounding the development of major modern property forms, and are those forms adequate to the environmental problems we now confront? Are there property relationships outside of the law? How do property relations and conflicts change in response to changing human control over nature, and how can different kinds of property arrangements lead to, or help to solve, environmental and social problems? Readings will review debates over common property; the beneﬁts and dangers of privatization of environmental goods; distinctions between formal and informal property rights; the development of zoning and other regulation of private property; and contemporary debates over intellectual property rights in nature, and relationships among trade, property rights, and environmental quality.The course will be of interest to students interested in environmental policy, land use planning and management, law, the areas of nature-society relations and historical geography, and environmental history. Students will gain a sophisticated understanding of the central underpinnings of much property and environmental regulation, and familiarity with many cutting-edge debates in these domains, both domestically and internationally.

HIST 6N: History and Weather: How Weather Played an Instrumental Role,"In HIST 6N / METEO 6N, we'll survey how weather and history are integrated throughout time. Moving from past to present, the course will use case studies to navigate historical moments where weather shaped the outcome. Each case study will have a historical, cultural, and meteorological analysis of the event so students gain a deeper understanding of the national or international event and the integration of science and history. Weather has shaped the outcome of major world events. For example, a weather forecast led to the delay of the Allied invasion of Normandy (DDay), record cold weather in Florida led to the Challenger Space Shuttle explosion, General George Washington used fog to conceal the withdrawal of his troops at the Battle of Long Island, and the list goes on. The case studies range from the Revolutionary War through present day, and this period of history has been selected because there are ﬁrsthand accounts of the weather and/or recorded weather data for each event. The meteorological study examines the event's atmospheric conditions. How or why did they occur? How did they affect the event? Therefore, students will learn basic meteorology and climatology. They will also analyze weather maps and scientiﬁc data. The historical study provides context for the event. What lead to the event? What happened during the event? What are the event's lasting impacts? To better understand the decisions that leaders faced, students will be asked to assess risk and make decisions based on the same weather data or information leaders at the time had. Students will also explain the context, cause, and effects of major historical moments in everyday language to an audience of their peers through discussions and/or projects. The cultural study examines each event from a psychological and sociological point of view. What were the mindsets of the people and cultures involved in the event? How does the event connect to or parallel things in today's society? How would a present day culture react? This study will give students a better understanding of cultural differences in the world and how those cultural differences can alter the course of history. Time in the course is equally split between United States and international topics, and there will be frequent discussion of current events.

"HIST 182: Asian Trade: Economy, Industrialization and Capitalism in Asia","An historical overview of economy, industrialization, globalization and capitalism in Asia from the 16th century to present. ASIA (HIST) 182 Asian Trade: Economy, Industrialization and Capitalism in Asia (3) (GH;IL) (BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. Asian economies have experienced spectacular growth in the second half of the 20th century. But this growth is part of a longer story of Asian commerce and trade and its relationship to and integration with (and, in some cases, isolation from) global patterns of exchange. Moreover, these exchanges are best understood alongside the politics, society, and culture--sometimes local, sometimes regional--that shaped trade and business in entrepots, capitals, and hinterlands throughout Asia. This course begins with a historical exploration of the economic development and social change and ends by asking what lies in store for one of the world&rsquo;s fastest growing economic regions. By offering a historical frame for Asian economic experience , students will gain insight into the strengths and weaknesses of prevailing theories that tend to overstate centralized control, market mechanisms, and cultural determination. Asian economies and markets are quite diverse, consisting of emerging and mature markets, making it difﬁcult to view them through a single lens. As a result this course seeks to introduce students to a variety of conceptual frameworks in these countries. Examinations of the major economic players China, India, and Japan form the backbone of the course, but the precise geographic emphasis will vary with instructor, and may also include discussions of Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Indonesia, Taiwan, and other Asian states. Themes of the course will vary depending on instructor, but may include industrialization, sustainability and the environment, gender and labor, protest and political reform, and consumerism and advertising, among others. The course will also offer a general introduction to economic theories that underpin the concepts of globalization, capitalism, and socialism as they are understood in an Asian context. This course is intended as an introduction to Asia for those with particular interests in Business, Economics, Global Studies, Labor, and/or Government. Through weekly readings, ﬁlms and class discussion students will be introduced to the development of Asian economies in the global context.

HIST 292N: Witches and Witchcraft from the Middle Ages to the Present,"This course will explore the social and cultural history of witches and witchcraft from the late Middle ages in Europe and the U.S. to the present. The very nature and broad scope of the topic lends itself to an interdisciplinary approach that combines history, folklore, religious studies, criminology, women's studies, art history, English literature and popular culture. Historically, real individuals were accused of witchcraft and suffered persecution and punishment accordingly. Others proclaimed themselves to be witches and the practice continues to attract adherents today such as in the modern Wiccan movement. However, modern consensus views witches as ﬁctions: ﬁgures of magical power in folklore, literature, visual art and popular culture. From Shakespeare's Macbeth to the characters in the popular Harry Potter books and ﬁlms, ﬁctional witches have haunted European and American culture for centuries. This course will explore the complex interplay of fact and ﬁction in the history of witches and witchcraft. In other words, how do ﬁctions become powerful enough to inform history? The course will also focus on the historical status of witches as a source of power outside of, and in opposition to, established political, religious and social structures. Since those accused of witchcraft were predominately women, how has witchcraft functioned as a means of empowerment for women as well as a tool for their persecution? And how has the representation of witches influenced attitudes towards women both historically and today? The course will begin with an historical inquiry into the belief in witchcraft during the late Middle Ages in Europe and the social and cultural role witches played in society. We will look at texts such as the Malleus Maleﬁcarum (Hammer of Witches) published in 1486 as a guide for hunting and destroying witches, as well as studies on the more constructive role witchcraft may have offered women and communities. The course will be organized chronologically and move back and forth between history, such as the Salem witch trials, and the representations of that history in art, literature and ﬁlm. Particular emphasis will be placed on the visual arts, from the engravings of German Renaissance artists such as Albrecht Durer and Hans Baldung Grien, the gothic paintings of Francisco Goya during the Romantic period, to contemporary artist Louise Bourgeois' monument to those executed as witches in Norway. The course will end with analysis of images of witches in popular culture, movies and television, and with a discussion of the modern representations of the domesticated witch and the femme fatale.

Indeed, many technology problems are multi-dimensional--they have an economic dimension, a legal dimension, a human resources dimension, and so on. This course will require students to analyze, evaluate, and test alternative solutions and to weigh their advantages and disadvantages for the organization. Students will be evaluated in three ways: by the effectiveness of their team's solution of the technical or organizational problem; by the quality of the students' written and oral presentations; and by the quality of their project management and internal communication. A substantial written paper will be required of each student and each time; in addition, each team will also construct a Web-site for sharing results. Other technologies will be used as required by the project. It is expected that membership on teams of students will be drawn from the various options in the Information Sciences and Technology major. At least nine credits (including at least one IST 300-level and one IST 400-level course) in the student's option must be completed before enrollment in IST 440W. This course should be offered every fall and spring semester beginning in the fall semester 2002. It will be taught in sections of 25 and have a total enrollment of approximately 100 per semester.

IST 452: Legal and Regulatory Environment of Privacy and Security,"Exploration of legal, regulatory, public policy, and ethical issues related to security and privacy for information technology professionals in public institutions, private enterprise, and IT services. IST 452 Legal and Regulatory Environment of Privacy and Security (3) Institutional constraints on security historically focused on traditional criminal enforcement and a slow but steady increase in civil remedies through the twentieth century. Professional security protection could satisfy reasonable assurance criteria by managing legal and regulatory risks based on commonly-held understandings of burglary, theft, conversion and widely-understood but related institutional constraints in the protection of physical property. This focus retained effectiveness so long as physical security over tangible property appeared successful, even extending to the maintenance of control over mainframe computers and their peripherals. However, the proliferation of networked computers has made access and storage ubiquitous, vastly increasing the vulnerability of conﬁdential data, private information and critical national security infrastructure. Security and privacy regulation compliance responsibility now falls much more harshly on both organizations and most of their individual personnel. These complex new duties constrain organizations in the data management industry as well as suppliers and users of data and all participants in the information supply chain, including consultants, software suppliers, applications service providers, maintenance, outsourcing and communications providers.Other factors exacerbate these liability risk management difﬁculties. Advances in network computer storage and use, the broadening perception of heightened value of information and the pervasive availability of rich data warehousing increase the vulnerability of data management. Risks of information theft and integrity losses as well as the explosion of privacy rights and national security concerns now require pervasive and fuller understanding of liability risk management principles/techniques among all managers and subordinates in the data management industry and in government. Information suppliers, handlers, owners and network service providers are increasingly exposed to civil litigation, regulatory oversight/ compliance and criminal prosecution for various information-related wrongs. For example, conﬁdentiality is compulsory for corporate trade secrets, privacy is required for personally identiﬁable information about individuals and secrecy is mandatory over matters of national security; all of which create complex legal duties that are fundamentally driving the design of information handling processes. This course surveys legal and regulatory constraints on information security and privacy practices.

LHR 100: Exploring Work and Employment,"Work and employment are central parts of the human experience. With that in mind, this course has two main objectives. First, to help better prepare students for the role that work and employment will play in their lives. And second, to introduce students to the ﬁelds of human resource management and employment relations. The course will begin by looking at the ways in which work and employment impact people's lives ﬁnancially, socially, and psychologically. It then examines a number of issues that impact the kind of experience that people have at work and that people entering the workforce need to be aware of, including the basic legal rights employees have related to employment, workplace privacy, employment discrimination, family-friendly policies at work, safety and health in the workplace, drug and alcohol testing, and the growing trend of working from home. The course then introduces students to human resource management as a ﬁeld. It also discusses the various ways that students will interact with human resources professionals when they begin applying for jobs, including the search and hiring process and, once they obtain employment, on issues such as compensation, beneﬁts, and job evaluation. As the employees in some workplaces are represented by labor unions, students will be introduced to the role that unions have historically played in American workplaces. The process for organizing a union will be addressed, as will the collective bargaining process through which employers and unions jointly determine wages and salaries, beneﬁts such as healthcare and pensions, and processes for ensuring fair treatment and due process in the workplace. New alternatives to unions that give workers a voice in their workplace will also be discussed. The ﬁnal section of the course will focus on globalization and immigration and their impact on work and employment around the world. Both the beneﬁts of globalization (lower costs on consumer goods) and its costs (job losses in developed countries and the exploitation of workers in poorer countries through substandard pay, sweatshops, and child labor) will be discussed, as will the beneﬁts and costs of immigration.

LHR 304: Labor and Employment Relations Fundamentals,"The course surveys the main elements of modern labor and employment relations systems in the U.S. and beyond. The course encourages students to use a framework for evaluating workplace outcomes according to three yardsticks: efﬁciency; equity; and voice. Focusing primarily on employee voice, the course introduces students to a variety of mechanisms that bring democracy, worker engagement, and worker influence to the workplace. Among these mechanisms are U.S.- styled collective bargaining, non-union systems of worker involvement, European works councils, and a new variety of ""alt-labor"" initiatives from around the world. In its single largest unit, the course focuses on U.S. workplaces, beginning with the historical and legal foundations of the modern U.S. labor relation system. This includes units examining union organizing campaigns, collective bargaining, and dispute resolution systems. Concluding weeks of the course look at issues surrounding the push for workplace flexibility, a comparative labor relations look at other country practices (include European works councils), emerging issues in global supply chains, ""alt-labor"" institutions and practices, the role of gender, race, and diversity initiatives at work, and the impact of automation and artiﬁcial intelligence on the future of work.

LHR 403: International Human Resource Studies,"Course exploring human resource management from an international perspective. LHR 403 International Human Resource Studies (3) (IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This course on International Human Resource Management expands beyond the traditional disciplines of HRM through a broader consideration of the impact of national contexts on these areas of organizational practice. The ﬁrst question addressed is whether 'HRM' actually means the same thing in different countries, especially given that the term 'HRM' was developed from US management practice and scholars. This opens the discussion as to how institutions and culture at the national level help to shape management practice. As organizations become increasinglyglobal, these issues of national culture and institutions can often stand in the way of a seamless progression of HRM across national boundaries. From a national culture perspective, the course compares how people in different countries see themselves and others around them, and how expectations, values and beliefs can differ in the workplace. This understanding is drawn from frameworks of national culture which describe the culture's multiple dimensions. This enables students to identify why and how it may be different working with colleagues from other cultures, as well as understanding the implications this can have for designing appropriate HRM practices. From a national institutions perspective, the course compares how institutions such as legislation, state intervention, trade union influence, education systems, and the respective power of shareholders versus stakeholders can impact on patterns of HRM and employee relations practices in different countries. For example, comparisons are made between economies with very high levels of employment regulation, explaining local employee rights and beneﬁts, and those in which ﬁrms have more autonomy to choose how to manage their employees. From a strategic perspective, the course looks at how multinational enterprises are managing this cultural and institutional complexity, making strategic choices in international HRM to ensure they achieve the ultimate balancing act of thinking global but acting local. It considers different strategies ﬁrms might take (from complete standardization of HRM to complete localization) and how this then translates into different roles and activities for the IHRM function. This section also explores how these ﬁrms manage their international staff (expatriates), as well as ﬁnally exploring ethical issues around outsourcing activities to lower cost countries, and the impact of a more globalized workforce on diversity and work-life balance issues.

LHR 427: Understanding Business Processes for LHR Professionals,"This course examines human resource management (HRM) and employment relations (ER) from a strategic perspective embedded in a complex and evolving organizational system. To be effective, students must understand how different organizational strategies interface with the entire set of HR/ER practices put in place. This approach also requires an ability to connect business functions, governance, organizational metrics and ﬁnancial considerations with investments in the broader HR/ER system. The goal of this course is to build business acumen by providing a foundational understanding of the components of a strategic and proactive HR/ER system. Through active learning, this course will encourage the development of analytical skills, personal competencies, and in-depth understanding of how various HRM and ER parts work together to shape organizational success. Students are more effective in their roles when they understand organizational strategic typologies, business functions, and governance structures that can affect the structure and implementation of the HRM/ER functions. Other topics include vertical and horizontal integration of the supply chain, and mergers and acquisitions, both of which are important to the work context. Basic ﬁnance and accounting concepts relevant to HRM/ER such as proﬁt and loss statements, balance sheets, and cash flow enable students to understand how managers and leaders make resource decisions. Students gain credibility with other organizational decision makers by better understanding concepts such as earnings per share, return on assets (ROA) and return on investment (ROI). Understanding the time value of money and implications for decisions regarding investments in people enables students to be more effective in decision-making roles. The goal is to provide students with the fundamentals of the business context as relevant to their roles as HRM and ER professionals. The use of metrics and measures to provide feedback to the organization and individual employees will be examined. The criticality of understanding appropriate metrics and the importance of ﬁnding or creating valid, reliable, and bias-free metrics is explored. Learning how to create balanced score cards and associated HRM/ER scorecards can provide actionable insight to all organizational stakeholders. Finally, exposure to conceptual frameworks related to ethics and risk assessment will enable students to apply such frameworks in an organizational context. The goal is to have HRM and ER students develop a deep understanding of perspectives, practices, and tools that connect HRM and ER policies and practices to an organization's context and strategy.

MATH 403H: Honors Classical Analysis I,"Development of a thorough understanding and technical mastery of foundations of classical analysis in the framework of metric spaces. MATH 403H Honors Classical Analysis I (3)The central aim of this course is to develop thorough understanding and technical mastery of foundations of classical analysis in the framework of metric spaces rather than multidimensional Euclidean spaces. This level of abstraction is essential since it is in the background of functional analysis, a fundamental tool for modern mathematics and physics. Another motivation for studying analysis in this wider context is that many general results about functions of one or several real variables are more easily grasped at this more abstract level, and, besides, the same methods and techniques are applicable to a wider class of problems, e.g. to the study of function spaces. This approach also brings to high relief some of the fundamental connections between analysis on one hand and (higher) algebra and geometry on the other. This course is a sequel to Math 312H; it is highly recommended to all mathematics, physics and natural sciences majors who are graduate school bound, and is a great opportunity for all Schreyer Scholars.

METEO 5: Severe and Unusual Weather,"Non-technical introduction to the physical processes important in the formation of various severe and unusual weather phenomena. METEO 5 provides a current, relevant, and scientiﬁcally accurate discussion of a wide range of severe and unusual weather. Severe weather has made a major imprint on the world's cultures and economies throughout history (e.g., the drought of the 1930s led to westward migration and changes in agriculture practices in the U.S., utilities in East Coast cities were placed underground after the Blizzard of 1888, and the severe winter of 1941-1942 helped change the momentum of World War II), and also has been prominent in our literature and entertainment (e.g., The Wizard of Oz, The Grapes of Wrath, Twister, The Perfect Storm). Students will learn about the fundamental principles that govern severe and unusual weather. Concepts are taught in a descriptive manner without relying heavily on mathematics; thus, the material is highly accessible to students with a wide variety of backgrounds. It is believed that learning about weather is enhanced by experiencing weather. For this reason, the class frequently draws upon examples of signiﬁcant historical and recent severe weather events. Students will be able to apply what they have learned immediately to weather events occurring near their homes or around the world. The course has four major themes. The unit on hazardous cold-season phenomena treats the formation of freezing and frozen precipitation, lake-effect snowstorms, and blizzards. The unit on hazardous warm-season weather treats thunderstorms and larger-scale conglomerations of thunderstorms known as convective systems, including hurricanes. Students also will learn about flash floods, lightning, tornadoes, downbursts, and hailstorms. The unit on hazardous weather triggered by mountainous terrain deals with topographically- forced gravity waves, downslope windstorms, and rotors. The ﬁnal unit treats a wide variety of unusual atmospheric optical phenomena resulting from the interaction of light with raindrops or ice crystals, such as rainbows, glories, and haloes. General Education: Natural Sciences (GN) GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think GenEd Learning Objective: Integrative ThinkingMETEO 6N: History and Weather: How Weather Played an Instrumental Role in Great World Events In HIST 6N / METEO 6N, we'll survey how weather and history are integrated throughout time. Moving from past to present, the course will use case studies to navigate historical moments where weather shaped the outcome. Each case study will have a historical, cultural, and meteorological analysis of the event so students gain a deeper understanding of the national or international event and the integration of science and history. Weather has shaped the outcome of major world events. For example, a weather forecast led to the delay of the Allied invasion of Normandy (DDay), record cold weather in Florida led to the Challenger Space Shuttle explosion, General George Washington used fog to conceal the withdrawal of his troops at the Battle of Long Island, and the list goes on. The case studies range from the Revolutionary War through present day, and this period of history has been selected because there are ﬁrsthand accounts of the weather and/or recorded weather data for each event. The meteorological study examines the event's atmospheric conditions. How or why did they occur? How did they affect the event? Therefore, students will learn basic meteorology and climatology. They will also analyze weather maps and scientiﬁc data. The historical study provides context for the event. What lead to the event? What happened during the event? What are the event's lasting impacts? To better understand the decisions that leaders faced, students will be asked to assess risk and make decisions based on the same weather data or information leaders at the time had. Students will also explain the context, cause, and effects of major historical moments in everyday language to an audience of their peers through discussions and/or projects. The cultural study examines each event from a psychological and sociological point of view. What were the mindsets of the people and cultures involved in the event? How does the event connect to or parallel things in today's society? How would a present day culture react? This study will give students a better understanding of cultural differences in the world and how those cultural differences can alter the course of history. Time in the course is equally split between United States and international topics, and there will be frequent discussion of current events.

METEO 469 From Meteorology to Mitigation: Understanding Global Warming (3) Human- caused climate change represents one of the great environmental challenges of our time. As it is inextricably linked with issues of energy policy, a familiarity with the fundamentals of climate change is therefore critical for those looking to careers in the energy ﬁeld. To appreciate the societal, environmental, and economic implications of policies governing greenhouse gas emissions, one must further understand the basic underlying science. METEO 469 serves to lay down the fundamental scientiﬁc principles behind climate change and global warming. A ﬁrm grounding in the science is then used as a launching point for exploring issues involving climate change impacts and mitigation. METEO 469 will introduce students to the basic information necessary for understanding Earth's climate, including the relevant atmospheric processes, and aspects of other key components of the climate system such as the cryosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. Students will learn how to do basic computations and to use theoretical models of the climate system of varying complexity to address questions regarding future climate change. Students, further, will explore the impacts of various alternative greenhouse gas emissions scenarios and investigate policies that would allow for appropriate stabilization of future greenhouse gas concentrations.

PLSC 90: Introduction to Security,"The study of security issues is more critical than ever, considering a series of global trends. Those reach from violent radicalization to arctic transformation, as well as include technology trends. All of those have an impact on security in our daily lives, in the public sector, and in the private sector. Together, both states and individuals are confronted with many pressing and often competing local, national, and global security challenges that demand thoughtful responses and solutions. Particularly challenging is the need to put in place security measures while ensuring that they do not infringe on the values they aim to protect. The multifaceted security crises of our time is rooted in a broad spectrum of hazards. It among other things stretches across lone wolf terrorists, natural disasters, public health emergencies, transnational organized crime, and cyber attacks; and it includes global counterterrorism, counterproliferation, and environmental change. All of those represent signiﬁcant problems facing our world today. At the same time, they provide opportunities for us to bring about changes that will signiﬁcantly increase the ongoing quality of life around the world. In order to do so, it is essential to develop analytical skills for risk assessment, policy analysis and strategy development. Critical thinking skills are also crucial since we need to be able to identify security gaps, unreasonable securitization trends, and point out fallacies of reasoning and misrepresentation of facts that may occur when responding to security threats. In this course, we will review the historical evolution of security studies, national and international security policies and strategies, human security and security management in business and industry. Further, in the rapidly changing world of security studies, it is important to understand the critical differences between concepts like strategic security, counterterrorism, protection, intelligence, homeland security, criminal justice, conflict studies, emergency management, threat assessment, human security, crisis management, disaster management, and related terms.

SRA 231: Decision Theory and Analysis,"Provides an overview of decision theoretical and analytical concepts and tools in the security risk analysis ﬁeld. SRA 231 Decision Theory and Analysis (3) Decision Theory and Analysis is designed for students to build an understanding of how to improve the judgment and decision making of individuals, groups and organizations. Behavioral decision theories provide the theoretical core for the course. These theories draw on insights from a diverse set of disciplines, including cognitive and social psychology as well as economics, statistics and philosophy.Offered annually (and more if demand requires), this course will foster understanding of: (a) the cognitive, emotional, social and institutional factors that influence judgment and choice, (b) normative (economic) models of rational choice, and (c) how judgment and decision making can be predicted and/or improved through prescriptive aids and models.Applications of these theories and methods to real-life venues will be used to engage and focus the students. For example, insights on how such concepts apply to supply chain security, bioterrorism threats, legal decision making, large-scale risk assessments (e.g., assessing risks of transnational threat), and ﬁrst-response/crisis decision making will be common. Where appropriate, real situations and cases are used to bring concepts and scenarios alive.Overall, the course emphasizes basic skills and concepts that enhance an individual's ability to understand why individuals, groups and organizations behave the way they do, how they formulate the issues and problems they confront, as well as to choose rationally among competing courses of action. 4642 Security and Risk Analysis (SRA) Enforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: SRA 211 and STAT 200",PDF,1.5,Risk Assessment,technical_skills-1,"{""risk assessment"": 1}"
SRA 268: Visual Analytics,"This course introduces the fundamental principles, methods, and tools of visual analytics that enable security and risk analysts to synthesize information and derive insight from massive, dynamic, ambiguous, and often conflicting data. Decisions in risk and security management are increasingly driven by data. Analysts are faced with a continuously growing set of data originated from a wide range of sources and in a wide variety of formats. Such data need to be analyzed in order to understand a situation and react promptly. This causes signiﬁcant information overload to analysts and prevents them from developing good situation awareness. Visual Analytics (VA) offers an effective solution for making sense of massive datasets by exploiting interactive visualization technologies to extend human cognitive abilities. It helps analysts in detecting the expected and discover the unexpected, providing timely, defensible, and in communicating ﬁndings and assessment effectively for action. SRA 268 provides students with a quick overview of the current state of the art in visual analytics and their applications in data-driven security investigation and risk assessment. It prepares students with advanced data analytic skills and critical thinking with data. Cases studies and projects showcase the applications of visual analytics in cyber security and intelligence analysis, emergency and crisis management, and business intelligence.

SOILS 71: Environmental Sustainability,"This class provides an introduction to environmental sustainability for students with no background in environmental science or soils. The concept of sustainability provides a framework for understanding environmental problems by balancing the needs of current society with the long-term needs of future societies and the environment. Sustainability also provides a framework for linking international cultures because environmental problems and solutions often cross political and cultural boundaries. The goal of the course is to develop critical thinking skills related to sustainable environmental choices. As we explore the concept of sustainability, we will discover the role of soil in mediating human-environment interactions by determining natural plant and animal abundance, supporting agriculture, and buffering the environment against modern pollution. The four themes of the class are: 1) Environment, Sustainability and Natural Resources, which introduces students to the scientiﬁc method and value systems that affect environmental choices, to fundamental ecological principles and to basic concepts of soil science and environmental science, 2) Challenges to Sustainability, in which we consider some of the major challenges to global sustainability; climate change, loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services, human population growth and resource consumption and waste management, 3) Feeding the World and its Impact on the Environment in which we consider the Malthusian dilemma of how we can feed ~10 billion of people in the near future together with the conservation dilemma of how we can maintain a healthy environment, and 4) Sustainability Solutions, in which we consider what has been done to achieve environmental protection while sustainably increasing food production and students are challenged to develop their own sustainability solution to a current issue somewhere in the world. The class will include ""soils cases"" in which examples from environmental soil science are used to convey principles of sustainability, and ""sustainability activities"" to see examples of sustainable environmental choices on campus or in State College. Students will complete the class with: 1) a survey of the key issues in global environmental sustainability, 2) exposure to current scientiﬁc information related to these issues, 3) an enhanced ability to interpret environmental data, 4) an increased knowledge of the role of soils in maintaining environmental quality, 5) an increased understanding of how environmental problems and solutions are global phenomena, requiring cooperation among many international cultures, and 6) a signiﬁcant depth of knowledge about ""what it takes"" to feed 10 billion people while maintaining a healthy environment.

The course examines the concepts and key issues of sustainability through a variety of literary, scientiﬁc, political, and popular texts. Class discussions will trace the roots of sustainability in environmental writing, will analyze the diverse debates surrounding sustainability, and will consider local, national, and international texts about sustainability. Students will interact with invited guest speakers, conduct ﬁeld research on sustainability in local communities and institutions, and create their own narratives and scenarios for sustainable futures based on their ﬁndings and speculations. The course will address central issues of sustainability in society today, including: - What are the historical and cultural foundations of sustainability? - How is sustainability a political, social, and ethical issue? - How do crises and disasters create challenges for sustainability? - How is sustainability connected to Undergraduate - The Pennsylvania State University 2024-2025 4707 local, urban, and transnational environments? The goal of the course is to develop two types of awareness. First, students will develop an awareness of the key discussions about sustainability in society today. Second, students will cultivate a critical awareness of how debates about sustainability are shaped through the written and spoken word. Sustainability is more than just protecting the great outdoors or using a recycling bin. It is also a product of the discourse surrounding it. In other words, sustainability-and what we think, say, and do concerning it-is influenced by what other groups and individuals have written or said about it. Sustainability debates are shaped by more than simply ""the facts"" surrounding environmental issues; they are also shaped by the persuasive tactics and rhetorical choices writers and speakers make. Students will spend the semester analyzing, discussing, and creating texts that engage the key issues and most important topics of sustainability and environmentalism.
