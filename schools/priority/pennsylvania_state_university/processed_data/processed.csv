For non-science majors The Big Bang Universe (3) (GN)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. Astronomical observations made during the last 70 years, combined with mathematical physical theory (Einstein's General Relativity), has led to a dramatic new view of the history of the Universe. Ten to twenty billion years ago, all the material that is now contained in stars, planets, and galaxies was then compressed into a region, smaller than a pinhead, and so hot that atoms could not survive. This fiery cauldron cooled and expanded, forming hydrogen and helium, and eventually all the materials and structures that we know today. This course will discuss the evidence, theories and controversies of this new scientific cosmology, commonly known as 'the Big Bang'. This class is designed for the non-science students who, after learning the fundamentals of astronomy in (GN), (GN) or (GN), want to pursue further the questions of cosmology. The great success of the Big Bang theory in explaining the expansion of the Universe, the synthesis of the chemical elements, and the relic radiation leftover from the first moments are reviewed. Some of the questions discussed are still debated in the scientific community. For example: Why do some galaxies have stunning spiral structures, while others are relatively featureless ellipticals? What is the ""dark matter"" that may have emerged from the Big Bang, and seems to make a larger contribution to the mass of the universe than all of the material we are familiar with? What can the most distant and oldest objects we know of, the quasars, tell us about how galaxies formed? In presenting the development of this subject, the empirical and conceptual methods of modern physical science are conveyed. Students are assigned problems that exercise the use of elementary mathematics and physics to address real issues, and will confront discussions of interpretation and meaning in essays.

ASIA (HIST) 182 Asian Trade: Economy, Industrialization and Capitalism in Asia (3) (GH;IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. Asian economies have experienced spectacular growth in the second half of the 20th century. But this growth is part of a longer story of Asian commerce and trade and its relationship to and integration with (and, in some cases, isolation from) global patterns of exchange. Moreover, these exchanges are best understood alongside the politics, society, and culture--sometimes local, sometimes regional--that shaped trade and business in entrepots, capitals, and hinterlands throughout Asia. This course begins with a historical exploration of the economic development and social change and ends by asking what lies in store for one of the world&rsquo;s fastest growing economic regions. By offering a historical frame for Asian economic experience , students will gain insight into the strengths and weaknesses of prevailing theories that tend to overstate centralized control, market mechanisms, and cultural determination. Asian economies and markets are quite diverse, consisting of emerging and mature markets, making it difficult to view them through a single lens. As a result this course seeks to introduce students to a variety of conceptual frameworks in these countries.

"['ARTH 292N: Witches and Witchcraft from the Middle Ages to the Present', 'Witches and Witchcraft from the Middle Ages to the Present']","This course will explore the social and cultural history of witches and witchcraft from the late Middle ages in Europe and the U.S. to the present. The very nature and broad scope of the topic lends itself to an interdisciplinary approach that combines history, folklore, religious studies, criminology, women's studies, art history, English literature and popular culture. Historically, real individuals were accused of witchcraft and suffered persecution and punishment accordingly. Others proclaimed themselves to be witches and the practice continues to attract adherents today such as in the modern Wiccan movement. However, modern consensus views witches as fictions: figures of magical power in folklore, literature, visual art and popular culture. From Shakespeare's Macbeth to the characters in the popular Harry Potter books and films, fictional witches have haunted European and American culture for centuries. This course will explore the complex interplay of fact and fiction in the history of witches and witchcraft. In other words, how do fictions become powerful enough to inform history? The course will also focus on the historical status of witches as a source of power outside of, and in opposition to, established political, religious and social structures. Since those accused of witchcraft were predominately women, how has witchcraft functioned as a means of empowerment for women as well as a tool for their persecution? And how has the representation of witches influenced attitudes towards women both historically and today? The course will begin with an historical inquiry into the belief in witchcraft during the late Middle Ages in Europe and the social and cultural role witches played in society. We will look at texts such as the Malleus Maleficarum (Hammer of Witches) published in 1486 as a guide for hunting and destroying witches, as well as studies on the more constructive role witchcraft may have offered women and communities. The course will be organized chronologically and move back and forth between history, such as the Salem witch trials, and the representations of that history in art, literature and film. Particular emphasis will be placed on the visual arts, from the engravings of German Renaissance artists such as Albrecht Durer and Hans Baldung Grien, the gothic paintings of Francisco Goya during the Romantic period, to contemporary artist Louise Bourgeois' monument to those executed as witches in Norway. The course will end with analysis of images of witches in popular culture, movies and television, and with a discussion of the modern representations of the domesticated witch and the femme fatale.",https://bulletins.psu.edu/university-course-descriptions/undergraduate/arth/,4.0,CCUS,production-3,"{""ccus"": 2}"

"['PLSC 90: Introduction to Security', 'Introduction to Security']","The study of security issues is more critical than ever, considering a series of global trends. Those reach from violent radicalization to arctic transformation, as well as include technology trends. All of those have an impact on security in our daily lives, in the public sector, and in the private sector. Together, both states and individuals are confronted with many pressing and often competing local, national, and global security challenges that demand thoughtful responses and solutions. Particularly challenging is the need to put in place security measures while ensuring that they do not infringe on the values they aim to protect. The multifaceted security crises of our time is rooted in a broad spectrum of hazards. It among other things stretches across lone wolf terrorists, natural disasters, public health emergencies, transnational organized crime, and cyber attacks; and it includes global counterterrorism, counterproliferation, and environmental change. All of those represent significant problems facing our world today. At the same time, they provide opportunities for us to bring about changes that will significantly increase the ongoing quality of life around the world. In order to do so, it is essential to develop analytical skills for risk assessment, policy analysis and strategy development. Critical thinking skills are also crucial since we need to be able to identify security gaps, unreasonable securitization trends, and point out fallacies of reasoning and misrepresentation of facts that may occur when responding to security threats. In this course, we will review the historical evolution of security studies, national and international security policies and strategies, human security and security management in business and industry. Further, in the rapidly changing world of security studies, it is important to understand the critical differences between concepts like strategic security, counterterrorism, protection, intelligence, homeland security, criminal justice, conflict studies, emergency management, threat assessment, human security, crisis management, disaster management, and related terms. Based on this, students will learn how security issues relate to their chosen academic discipline and professional goals.

"['PLSC 114: Winning Political Support Through Persuasion', 'Winning Political Support Through Persuasion']","The purposes of this course are to introduce students to the comparative study of political systems, some of their parts, and the functioning of those parts, and to develop a capacity for effective, ethical citizenship. Real-world attempts to convince various audiences will be analyzed with respect to their appeals to the emotions of their respective audiences, often through framing the candidacy or policy under consideration in ways intended to stimulate fear, hope, or anxiety in order to command the attention of audiences. The use of words, other symbols, and non-verbal stimuli with strong emotional and normative content will be highlighted. The class will also evaluate efforts to establish credibility with audiences through references to endorsements, demonstrations or claims of expertise, goodwill, and good sense. Lastly, the logical validity of inferences and deductions made in the attempts to convince will be considered so that flattery, manipulation, bargaining, deception, and intimidation can be distinguished from genuine persuasion. So that students might see how characterizations of attempts to convince might be placed into a provisional context, the study is comparative. It will look at attempts in the U.S. as well as some other country. In general, so that the attempts at winning over audiences might be as comparable and as comprehensible as possible, the issue should be as similar as possible and the other country should be Anglophone. Although systems of elections and governance and controversial issues inevitably vary within and between countries, it is possible to find elections and policy controversies with sufficient similarities to make cross-national comparisons of attempts at convincing their respective audiences a fruitful exercise. For example, one might build the course around the televised debates and campaign ads for the mayoral elections in Vancouver and Seattle and the efforts to generate support and opposition to oil pipelines in the two countries. By looking at the different strategies used in attempts to convince elites, the citizenry and parts of the citizenry in the two countries, it is possible to raise questions about the workings of the political systems in the two countries. Specifically, students can examine some of the ways that historical geopolitical, constitutional, economic, and demographic differences between and within the two countries are manifested in the political processes of the two countries. By leading students to consider such questions, this course can induce them to undertake further study that will equip them with the methodological tools to investigate these issues in greater depth. Moreover, by providing students with the basic outlines of well-supported valid inference and challenging them to detect of the most common informal fallacies in efforts to convince and create an outline for their own attempt at political persuasion, (GS) will help build capabilities that are necessary for responsible and effective and ethical citizenship.",https://bulletins.psu.edu/university-course-descriptions/undergraduate/plsc/,3.5,Pipeline,delivery_and_storage-3,"{""pipeline"": 1}"
"['PNG 450: Drilling Engineering', 'Drilling Engineering']",": Drilling Engineering covers the design and analysis of oil-field drilling operations and equipment. This course addresses a critical issue in petroleum and natural gas engineering: how to drill and complete oil and gas wells in a sound, economical, and environmentally safe manner. Drilling technology has advanced greatly since the first commercial oil well in the U.S. was drilled in northwest Pennsylvania in 1859. The true vertical depth of the well has grown from 69.5 feet from then to more than 15,000 ft, with the deepest at more than 40,000 feet, today. The horizontal length of a well has grown from theoretically zero to more than 10,000 feet, with the longest at 40,000 feet. The temperature and pressure of the formation that petroleum engineers need to drill through could easily reach 350 F and 20,000 psi or higher, and the formation and fracture gradient window becomes narrower, all making drilling and completion more challenging. In summary, it is becoming increasingly more challenging to drill wells. Thus, engineering design becomes more critical. The objectives of this course are to introduce the students to the science of drilling and completion. This includes learning the fundamentals of drilling fluids and drilling fluid design, and applying fluid mechanics and quantifying drilling hydraulics for complex fluid flow through drilling string and annular spaces. The course will also discuss the concepts and quantify the formation pressure and fracture pressure gradients for different methods of drilling. A key task for students will be to learn the methods for characterization, selection and optimization of casing design, and optimized bit design, and finally the course will discuss how to design directional and horizontal wells to optimize production and recovery from mature fields and unconventional resources, such as coalbed methane, shale gas, and tight oil in Pennsylvania. This course is a prerequisite for petroleum and natural gas engineering major courses.

The course will begin by looking at the ways in which work and employment impact people's lives financially, socially, and psychologically. It then examines a number of issues that impact the kind of experience that people have at work and that people entering the workforce need to be aware of, including the basic legal rights employees have related to employment, workplace privacy, employment discrimination, family-friendly policies at work, safety and health in the workplace, drug and alcohol testing, and the growing trend of working from home. The course then introduces students to human resource management as a field. It also discusses the various ways that students will interact with human resources professionals when they begin applying for jobs, including the search and hiring process and, once they obtain employment, on issues such as compensation, benefits, and job evaluation. As the employees in some workplaces are represented by labor unions, students will be introduced to the role that unions have historically played in American workplaces. The process for organizing a union will be addressed, as will the collective bargaining process through which employers and unions jointly determine wages and salaries, benefits such as healthcare and pensions, and processes for ensuring fair treatment and due process in the workplace. New alternatives to unions that give workers a voice in their workplace will also be discussed. The final section of the course will focus on globalization and immigration and their impact on work and employment around the world.

"['LHR 403: International Human Resource Studies', 'International Human Resource Studies']","Course exploring human resource management from an international perspective. International Human Resource Studies (3) (IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This course on International Human Resource Management expands beyond the traditional disciplines of HRM through a broader consideration of the impact of national contexts on these areas of organizational practice. The first question addressed is whether 'HRM' actually means the same thing in different countries, especially given that the term 'HRM' was developed from US management practice and scholars. This opens the discussion as to how institutions and culture at the national level help to shape management practice. As organizations become increasingly global, these issues of national culture and institutions can often stand in the way of a seamless progression of HRM across national boundaries. From a national culture perspective, the course compares how people in different countries see themselves and others around them, and how expectations, values and beliefs can differ in the workplace. This understanding is drawn from frameworks of national culture which describe the culture's multiple dimensions. This enables students to identify why and how it may be different working with colleagues from other cultures, as well as understanding the implications this can have for designing appropriate HRM practices. From a national institutions perspective, the course compares how institutions such as legislation, state intervention, trade union influence, education systems, and the respective power of shareholders versus stakeholders can impact on patterns of HRM and employee relations practices in different countries. For example, comparisons are made between economies with very high levels of employment regulation, explaining local employee rights and benefits, and those in which firms have more autonomy to choose how to manage their employees. From a strategic perspective, the course looks at how multinational enterprises are managing this cultural and institutional complexity, making strategic choices in international HRM to ensure they achieve the ultimate balancing act of thinking global but acting local. It considers different strategies firms might take (from complete standardization of HRM to complete localization) and how this then translates into different roles and activities for the IHRM function. This section also explores how these firms manage their international staff (expatriates), as well as finally exploring ethical issues around outsourcing activities to lower cost countries, and the impact of a more globalized workforce on diversity and work-life balance issues.",https://bulletins.psu.edu/university-course-descriptions/undergraduate/lhr/,2.0,Resource Management,technical_skills-1,"{""resource management"": 2}"

Legal and Regulatory Environment of Privacy and Security (3) Institutional constraints on security historically focused on traditional criminal enforcement and a slow but steady increase in civil remedies through the twentieth century. Professional security protection could satisfy reasonable assurance criteria by managing legal and regulatory risks based on commonly-held understandings of burglary, theft, conversion and widely-understood but related institutional constraints in the protection of physical property. This focus retained effectiveness so long as physical security over tangible property appeared successful, even extending to the maintenance of control over mainframe computers and their peripherals. However, the proliferation of networked computers has made access and storage ubiquitous, vastly increasing the vulnerability of confidential data, private information and critical national security infrastructure. Security and privacy regulation compliance responsibility now falls much more harshly on both organizations and most of their individual personnel. These complex new duties constrain organizations in the data management industry as well as suppliers and users of data and all participants in the information supply chain, including consultants, software suppliers, applications service providers, maintenance, outsourcing and communications providers.Other factors exacerbate these liability risk management difficulties. Advances in network computer storage and use, the broadening perception of heightened value of information and the pervasive availability of rich data warehousing increase the vulnerability of data management. Risks of information theft and integrity losses as well as the explosion of privacy rights and national security concerns now require pervasive and fuller understanding of liability risk management principles/techniques among all managers and subordinates in the data management industry and in government. Information suppliers, handlers, owners and network service providers are increasingly exposed to civil litigation, regulatory oversight/compliance and criminal prosecution for various information-related wrongs. For example, confidentiality is compulsory for corporate trade secrets, privacy is required for personally identifiable information about individuals and secrecy is mandatory over matters of national security; all of which create complex legal duties that are fundamentally driving the design of information handling processes.

"['FSC 432: Petroleum Processing', 'Petroleum Processing']","Transportation of people and goods in many parts of the world depend almost completely on petroleum fuels, such as gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel, and marine fuel. Apart from the fuels, materials that are necessary for operating the combustion engines of cars, trucks, planes, and trains also come from petroleum. These materials include lubricating oils (motor oils), greases, tires on the wheels of the vehicles, and asphalt to pave the roads for smooth rides in transportation vehicles. All petroleum fuels and many materials are produced by processing of crude oil in petroleum refineries. Petroleum refineries also supply feedstock to the petrochemicals and chemical industry for producing all consumer goods from rubber and plastics (polymers) to cosmetics and medicine. This course explains how physical processes and chemical reactions that take place in separate petroleum refinery units are integrated to convert crude oil into desired fuels and materials. Refinery processes are divided into four types that include separation, conversion, finishing, and support. The overall objective of petroleum refining is to convert crude oil into fuels and materials that comply with commercial specifications and environmental regulations. All refining processes and refinery operations are also subjected to the applicable environmental regulations. A historical evolution of process concepts is introduced to demonstrate how the refining efficiency has increased with significant reduction of pollutant emissions from individual refinery processes. The principal objectives of this course are to enable students to: 1. explain the market drivers for the refining industry (ABET student outcome 2). 2. indicate what crude oils consist of and how crude oils are characterized based on their physical properties (ABET 1, 2); 3. express the objectives of petroleum refining and classify the processes used in petroleum refining (ABET 1, 2, 7); 4. demonstrate how a petroleum refinery works and sketch a flow diagram that integrates all refining processes and the resulting refinery products (ABET 2); 5. examine how each refinery process works and how physical and chemical principles are applied to achieve the objectives of each refinery process (ABET 1, 2, 7); 6. assess implications of changing crude oil feedstocks on refinery configuration and propose strategies to resolve conflicts with degrading crude oil quality and increasingly stringent environmental regulations on petroleum fuels (ABET outcome 4, 7); 7. discuss different sources of natural gas and explain how natural gas is processed at well sites and in processing plants with application of selected refinery processes and other physical operations (ABET 1, 2).",https://bulletins.psu.edu/university-course-descriptions/undergraduate/fsc/,8.0,Environmental Regulation;Combustion,sustainability_and_policy-4;engineering_capabilities-2,"{""environmental regulation"": 3, ""combustion"": 1}"

"['GEOG 10: Physical Geography:  An Introduction', 'Physical Geography:  An Introduction']","Survey and synthesis of processes creating geographical patterns of natural resources, with application of basic environmental processes in resource management. GEOG 010 Introduction to Physical Geography (3) (BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. Introduction to Physical Geography systematically examines the spatial patterns and interrelationships among physical elements at the earth's surface. Particular emphasis is given to developing an integrative view of how atmospheric, hydrologic, geomorphic, and biotic processes control the patterns of climate, water, landforms, soils, and biota across a local-to-global continuum. Those physical elements that influence and/or are influenced by people are the primary focus of study. Physical geography does not simply discuss the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere in isolation; instead, it concentrates on understanding the integration of these realms of the natural world. For example, the study of weathering processes demonstrates how the physical and chemical breakdown of Earth's surface material depends on the interaction of air, water, and biota with rock. The focus of physical geography is unlike the component disciplines from which it draws. On the one, hand, meteorology focuses on the atmosphere above our heads. Hydrology focuses on water in isolation from people. Geology and soil science focus on the Earth beneath our feet. Biology and ecology focus on the plants, animals, and ecosystems in isolation from people. One the other hand, physical geography concentrates on the surface of the Earth where the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere intersect. Introduction to Physical Geography is concerned with the human habitat-the life layer in which humans interact with their natural world. Like all geography, five recurring themes permeate Introduction to Physical Geography : location, place, regions, movement, and human-environment relationships. Physical geographers not only are interested in where natural phenomena are located on Earth's surface, but also they want to know the answers to such questions as:1. What is special about the physical processes that take place in a location? 2. How does the physical geography of a place relate to other places in the region? 3. How does energy and mass flow into and out of a region? 4. How do biophysical processes change as we move up and down spatial scales? 5. How do people influence natural processes? How do these processes influence people? Other disciplines typically do not cover these spatial and nature-society themes systematically. Physical geographers have developed and adopted many tools to address these themes. Maps are obvious choices, but geographers also use a wide array of photographic and imaging technologies to study the distribution of Earth processes and the processes themselves. They use geographic information systems and computer models to manipulate, display, and analyze spatial data. Introduction to Physical Geography acquaints students with many of these tools.

French Semantics (3) The aim of this course is to provide upper level undergraduate students in French with a relatively informal introduction to the field of semantics as it applies to the French language. Semantics is the subfield of theoretical linguistics that seeks to make explicit the rules native speakers use to interpret stable aspects of the meaning of natural language sentences. The course will begin by comparing and contrasting semantic and pragmatic aspects of meaning -an important undertaking since only the former are assumed to be subject to invariable rules of grammar. The conclusions reached in this portion of the course will then be extended to account for a very special type of language -humor -in a particular context, France. That as, it will be shown that a more complete understanding of this linguistic behavior entails recognition of the relative contributions of pragmatics and semantics. We will then turn to a survey of the classic model-theoretic approach to lexical and compositional aspects of semantic meaning, with important (sociolinguistic) refinements to the standard approach to lexical semantics being discussed in detail. With a survey of the fundamentals of the field in place, we will then undertake an investigation of specific topics in semantics, looking first at the status of thematic roles in semantic theory (focusing on work by David Dowty). Here we will examine the important implications his work holds for the initial mapping of arguments into sentence structure, not only for primary transitive verbs, but also unaccusative and psych-verbs.

Geography of International Affairs (3) (GS;IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. Geography of International Affairs uses the organizing principle of geographic scale to examine the spatial patterns of and interrelationships among political processes and institutions. Particular emphasis is given to developing an integrative view of how global, national, local and individual scale processes interact to produce patterns of peace and conflict. The course analyzes how the actions of individuals, states and other political actors are influenced by their dynamic geographical contexts. The political geography approach does not simply discuss the war, peace, nationalism, terrorism, and religious organizations in isolation; instead, it concentrates on understanding the integration of these processes, and how their integration mediates political decisions and outcomes. Geography of International Affairs is concerned with the geopolitical context, broadly defined - the manner in which spaces and places are combinations of the political and the social, the domestic and the international, the global and the local - and how it partially determines the form and outcomes of politics. As a course in geography, Geography of International Affairs encourages students to interpret political problems, actions, and disputes through the lens of the Six Essential Elements of Geography (National Geographic): Places and Regions; Physical Systems; Human Systems: Environment and Society; the World in Spatial Terms; and Uses of Geography. Further, this course also encourages students to examine and interpret international affairs through the lens of different geopolitical theories, developed by the likes of Ratzel, Mahan, Mackinder, Spykman, Kissinger, Wallerstein, and others.

To achieve desired conservation outcomes, on-the-ground forest practices must comply with minimum standards detailed in regulatory and/or voluntary management guidelines (i.e., Best Management Practices, BMPs) to not be harmful to the environment or local people. Further, many private and public forest management entities follow voluntary global and national third-party forest certification schemes that promote environmentally responsible management of the world's forests. Compliance with certification standards is evaluated through annual field audits as the central element to verify that forest operations meet sustainability criteria. Because timber harvesting now constitutes the predominant disturbance regime in northeastern forests, poorly planned, timed, and executed logging operations constitute the most serious threat to forest conservation and sustainability in managed forests and thus receive particular scrutiny in field audits. Foresters must therefore ensure that forest practices do not injure advance tree regeneration and ground flora, damage structural legacies such as residual trees and deadwood, reduce the potential to sequester carbon, undermine biodiversity and wildlife goals (e.g., breeding success), or adversely affect soil structure and site productivity (e.g., compaction and soil erosion), water quality, wetlands, riparian areas, visual quality, and cultural and spiritual values. This course traces the evolution of forest conservation and sustainability and introduces students to modern, low impact timber harvest systems and a variety of other forest practices intended to safeguard biodiversity, maintain the productive capacity of forests, and protect soil and water resources.

Our own property relations are often all but invisible to us precisely because they are so deeply woven into our perceptions, consciousness, social structures, and everyday experiences of the world. It is thus easy to overlook the fact that we live within highly specific and contingent property arrangements and that changing circumstances are prompting important changes in contemporary property relations.This course explores these issues with a particular focus on their implications for environmental politics and regulation. We will address questions such as: Is the privatization and commodification of nature a recipe for ecological disaster, or the most effective means of preservation? Can we own the weather? What were the historical-geographical circumstances surrounding the development of major modern property forms, and are those forms adequate to the environmental problems we now confront? Are there property relationships outside of the law? How do property relations and conflicts change in response to changing human control over nature, and how can different kinds of property arrangements lead to, or help to solve, environmental and social problems? Readings will review debates over common property; the benefits and dangers of privatization of environmental goods; distinctions between formal and informal property rights; the development of zoning and other regulation of private property; and contemporary debates over intellectual property rights in nature, and relationships among trade, property rights, and environmental quality.The course will be of interest to students interested in environmental policy, land use planning and management, law, the areas of nature-society relations and historical geography, and environmental history.

A similar perspective on social entrepreneurship is based on Jean-Baptiste's definition of entrepreneurs as permanent value creators. If the primary objective of value creation is positive social change, then the entrepreneur can be categorized as a social entrepreneur. Sustainability and scalability of the venture to create social change on a larger scale is essential. Metaphorically, while conventional entrepreneurs might pursue the creation of multi-million dollar enterprises, social entrepreneurs strive to create multi-million smile enterprises, while understanding that their ability to expand their social returns bears a dynamic interdependence with their economic bottom line. The mission of the venture must be strongly aligned with the measured outcomes, and this emphasis on measuring social and economic impact is crucial to the efficacy and success of social enterprises.The theory and praxis of social entrepreneurship is constantly evolving within the complex framework of political, economic and social changes occurring at the global, national and local levels in the US and other countries. Students study the dynamics of social challenges, approaches to address them, and the conceptual framework of social innovation and social entrepreneurship from theoretical and practical perspectives.

"['EARTH 111N: Water: Science and Society', 'Water: Science and Society']","The Earth is often called ""The Blue Planet"", a reference to the fact that over two-thirds of its surface is covered by water. Despite its apparent abundance, water is a valuable and limited resource; less than 2.5% of the water on the planet is fresh, and only one third of that is potable. The small fraction of Earth¿s water that is useable to humans is distributed very unevenly. As a result, conflicts over water occur from the local level, for example: pitting rancher against developer - to the global level, at which nations square off against one-another in war and use water as a mechanism for imposing sanctions. The dire situation in some regions has spurred numerous research and technological endeavors, such as water desalinization, genetic engineering of crops, and major overhauls of agricultural practice. In this course, we explore the relationships between water and human populations, with emphasis on water resources and quality in the Western U.S., and how these have shaped history and modern politics. We will focus first on developing the scientific underpinnings of water¿s unique properties, behavior, movement, occurrence, and quality. With this background, we will then discuss key issues relating to modern and historical conflicts, human impacts on the natural world, and human engineering accomplishments driven by our thirst for this valuable resource. We will discuss historical examples from the American West, specifically the development of water resources in Arizona, Colorado and California. We will also explore modern and historical conflicts between stakeholders. Major themes will include political and economic conflicts over (1) water resources - for example, balancing agricultural and urban demands in the American west in the Denver and Los Angeles metropolitan areas, (2) water quality - for example, considering the impact of economically profitable human activities on water quality and transmission of disease, and (3) human impacts on natural processes, specifically connecting human activity with our cultural history of water use and exploration in the American West.",https://bulletins.psu.edu/university-course-descriptions/undergraduate/earth/,2.0,Water Quality,technical_skills-1,"{""water quality"": 2}"

The very nature and broad scope of the topic lends itself to an interdisciplinary approach that combines history, folklore, religious studies, criminology, women's studies, art history, English literature and popular culture. Historically, real individuals were accused of witchcraft and suffered persecution and punishment accordingly. Others proclaimed themselves to be witches and the practice continues to attract adherents today such as in the modern Wiccan movement. However, modern consensus views witches as fictions: figures of magical power in folklore, literature, visual art and popular culture. From Shakespeare's Macbeth to the characters in the popular Harry Potter books and films, fictional witches have haunted European and American culture for centuries. This course will explore the complex interplay of fact and fiction in the history of witches and witchcraft. In other words, how do fictions become powerful enough to inform history? The course will also focus on the historical status of witches as a source of power outside of, and in opposition to, established political, religious and social structures. Since those accused of witchcraft were predominately women, how has witchcraft functioned as a means of empowerment for women as well as a tool for their persecution? And how has the representation of witches influenced attitudes towards women both historically and today? The course will begin with an historical inquiry into the belief in witchcraft during the late Middle Ages in Europe and the social and cultural role witches played in society. We will look at texts such as the Malleus Maleficarum (Hammer of Witches) published in 1486 as a guide for hunting and destroying witches, as well as studies on the more constructive role witchcraft may have offered women and communities.

The course features three individual projects as well as a team project spanning the entire course. After taking this course, the students should be able to cover the entire pipeline of a data science project, from problem formulation to data science solutions. That is, start from a data driven problem, identify pertinent datasets to the problem and collect data, reason about the best techniques that should be used to solve the problem, implement algorithms and models, assess performance, and communicate actionable insights through both written reports and oral presentations. As one example, a fundamental principle of data science is that solutions for extracting useful knowledge from data must carefully consider the problem in the real world scenarios. This may sound obvious at first, but the notion underlies many choices that must be made in the process of data analytics, including problem formulation, method choice, solution evaluation, and general strategy formulation. Another fundamental principle is that predictive modeling can both inform and be informed by relevant knowledge (including theories, models, frameworks) of the relevant domains. This principle manifests itself throughout data science: in the specific design of many particular data sciences applications, and more generally as the basis for all intelligent solutions. In this course, this principle will be highlighted by case studies from multiple domains so that students can be inspired to apply this principle to their term projects. Lastly, as most data science projects are delivered as solutions as opposed to software deliverables, the ability for data scientists to communicate their results through concise and actionable insights plays a critical role in a data science project.

CRIM (CRIMJ) 432 Crime and the American Court System (3) CRIM/ , Crime and The American Court system, studies the courts from the lower courts to the Supreme Court and the various actors that play important roles in the functioning of the courts. First, the course studies the jurisdictions of the various courts and their organization in various state systems as well as the federal courts as well as the organization of state and federal administrative offices that manage the courts including the training of judges and the preparation of the court budget. Subsequent to the development of the basic understanding of the court jurisdiction and organization, the class studies the roles of the key actors in the day-in and day-out operation of the courts. In the spotlight are judges, prosecutors and defense attorneys although the role of the probation officers and clerk of courts are also intertwined with the processing of defendants. Of particular importance in this component of the course is the development of what is referred to as the court community and the focal concerns and goals that the court must consider as it processes cases. An, understanding of court community and focal concerns serves as crucial context for understanding the role of public policy as it attempts to shift or change the decision making of the court. One important dynamic of this course is the understanding that the court, although functioning as an institution to provide a neutral field on which accusations of criminality are to be played out, operates similarly to other organizations in that they are to be efficient (move cases with minimum overhead) and to be effective (provide justice, and protect the public). How the courts balance these competing demands and the informal processes that emerge in the processing of defendants is the key focus of the class. Finally, the course explores the attempts to reform the courts from the sentencing reforms such as determinate sentencing, mandatory minimums including '3 strikes' and sentencing guidelines. These issues highlight the political context of the courts and adaptability of the courts to attempts to change their values, and decisions.

E E 481 Control Systems (4) This course presents both classical and modern approaches to the modeling, analysis and control system design for continuous time systems. Students learn how to model both mechanical and electrical systems in the time and frequency domains using differential equations, transfer functions, state space methods and frequency domain (Bode) techniques. The goal of developing linear system models is to facilitate system analysis and control design. Modeling is followed by an in-depth study of systems analysis, including stability, transient response and steady state characteristics. The study of stability involves examining the effects of pole and zero placement, and the Routh criterion is used extensively. In the consideration of transient response characteristics, students investigate rise time, peak time, overshoot, and settling time. The primary steady state feature studied is the error between the reference signal input and the system output, and students learn to characterize steady state error through the determination of system type and computation of the error constants. Design of control systems focuses on altering one or more of the system characteristics by adding compensation. Students employ a variety of root locus techniques, proportional-plus integral-plus-derivative (PID), state feedback, and frequency response methods. Students begin with simple proportional, closed-loop control and examine pole migration through root locus plots. They then learn to apply more robust pole placement techniques using proportional and derivated (PD) control. Next, PID controllers are examined with a number of opportunities for design. After learning the classical control techniques, students then concentrate on state feedback control methods, including the design of partial- and full-order observers. Finally, students learn the relationship between time domain analysis and design and frequency domain (Bode) analysis of both magnitude and phase.

Guiding questions for students' explorations include: (1) How is food - its cultivation, preparation and enjoyment - a cultural, ecological and moral activity? and (2) How might farm/garden based education cultivate abiding relationships between people and their places/communities, their soils, their bodies, and to more just and humane relationships to others? In the first half of the course, students will be introduced to influential writers representing diverse perspectives within the humanities.The aim is that students conduct a reckoning of industrial, large-scale and corporate orientations to agriculture. Why? To discern desirable alternatives that promote the health and well-being of people, soils, and communities. Students will discern a vision of a just, sustainable and meaningful life. In the second half of the course, students apply their understandings of food, farm, justice and sustainability to developing farm/garden based learning experiences for others. To this end students will be introduced to farm/garden based education; constructivist, student-centered learning theories; curriculum development approaches; and the design of performance assessments.

"['CRIMJ 432: Crime and the American Court System', 'Crime and the American Court System']","This course examines the American court system including structure and the way courts process offenders with special focus on sentencing. CRIM (CRIMJ) 432 Crime and the American Court System (3) CRIM/ , Crime and The American Court system, studies the courts from the lower courts to the Supreme Court and the various actors that play important roles in the functioning of the courts. First, the course studies the jurisdictions of the various courts and their organization in various state systems as well as the federal courts as well as the organization of state and federal administrative offices that manage the courts including the training of judges and the preparation of the court budget. Subsequent to the development of the basic understanding of the court jurisdiction and organization, the class studies the roles of the key actors in the day-in and day-out operation of the courts. In the spotlight are judges, prosecutors and defense attorneys although the role of the probation officers and clerk of courts are also intertwined with the processing of defendants. Of particular importance in this component of the course is the development of what is referred to as the court community and the focal concerns and goals that the court must consider as it processes cases. An, understanding of court community and focal concerns serves as crucial context for understanding the role of public policy as it attempts to shift or change the decision making of the court. One important dynamic of this course is the understanding that the court, although functioning as an institution to provide a neutral field on which accusations of criminality are to be played out, operates similarly to other organizations in that they are to be efficient (move cases with minimum overhead) and to be effective (provide justice, and protect the public). How the courts balance these competing demands and the informal processes that emerge in the processing of defendants is the key focus of the class. Finally, the course explores the attempts to reform the courts from the sentencing reforms such as determinate sentencing, mandatory minimums including '3 strikes' and sentencing guidelines. These issues highlight the political context of the courts and adaptability of the courts to attempts to change their values, and decisions. This course serves as one core 400-level course in the major.

Five structural concepts or key themes - local knowledge, relational knowledge, empirical knowledge, spiritual knowledge, and traditional knowledge - provide a conceptual framework for understanding indigenous cultures and knowledge production and their unique contributions to western society in the 21st century. Students will be introduced to the Algonquian cultures of the Great Lakes Region and to the Ojibwe (Anishinaabeg), Odawa, and Potawatomi (Three Fires) cultures in particular. This course will introduce students to the distinctive ways indigenous people experience, understand, and know the world through their relationship with the land or region to which they belong. Too often, colonizers around the world have ignored indigenous knowledge systems even though these ways of knowing have sustained peoples, cultures, and environments for thousands of generations. Because these ways of knowing are generally preserved and transmitted through stories, music, ceremony, and embodied traditions, they are seldom understood and frequently dismissed by those who control the production of knowledge in the modern world. The knowledge of the indigenous peoples of the Great Lakes region will, in this course, be presented as an empirically grounded scientific body of knowledge and theory comparable and complementary to the European tradition and, in specific ways, enhancing the sustainability of western scientific knowledge and practice.

From the Renaissance heralded by Alain Locke, through the Civil Rights and Black Power Movements -and their attendant Black Arts Movement- and into the era of the Movement for Black Lives, course readings encompass a broad range of styles and genres, from realism, naturalism, and naturalist primitivism, through the experimental forms, magical realism, and ""postrace aesthetics"" of later times. The course invites students to think critically about the African American novel as a socially and politically engaged form, and to identify and analyze the long tradition of resistance that variously informs its development. Authors covered in the course might include major figures such as Claude McKay, Zora Neale Hurston, Nella Larsen, Wallace Thurman, Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, Ann Petry, James Baldwin, Ishmael Reed, Earnest Gaines, Alice Walker, Toni Morrison, Toni Cade Bambara, Octavia Butler, Gayle Jones, Samuel Delany, Charles Johnson, John Edgar Wideman, Colson Whitehead, and others. Still, the course gives due attention to lesser known/studied materials from the period, including graphic novels, satire, speculative fiction, performance novels, and various other experimental forms. Course readings and instruction give particular attention to how African American novels of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries variously engage social identity categories, like race, gender, class, and sexuality, and how they engage and resist various literary conventions associated with naturalism, modernism, and postmodernism. The course also traces the development of new thematic and aesthetic interests in a generation of writers whose fiction has been influenced by the explosion of interest in the graphic novel, the popularity of cultural forms such as hip hop, and the ascendancy of the digital age. Scholarly readings accompany primary texts to give students a sense of the critical work that has gone into and continues to go on in the study of African American literature.

It is the responsibility of crisis management specialists to see the crisis coming and move to minimize the impact or even relegate the impending crisis to a problem. It is far better to be proactive than reactive. Having a crisis management plan is important, but avoiding a crisis by identifying its weaknesses; identifying the resources the company can use before, during and after a crisis; identifying any perceived threats that can turn into a crisis, and identifying the things that company does well in a crisis can go a long way toward negating long-term negative effects of a crisis.",https://bulletins.psu.edu/university-course-descriptions/undergraduate/comm/,2.0,Risk Assessment,technical_skills-1,"{""risk assessment"": 2}"

The impacts of environmental change on human societies, and the roles those societies play in ecological modification, have deep roots in human evolution. This class focuses on providing students with tools to understand the foundations and cross-cultural expressions of resource use, environmental transformation, and their ecological interactions. The class has three goals: 1) introduce students to ways of thinking about ecological and social factors that shape variability in how humans define, use, and consume resources, 2) provide students the opportunity to explore archaeological, ethnographic, and ecological evidence of the interaction between human livelihoods and habitats across the entirety of the human experience, 3) utilize those concepts and evidence to investigate variability in contemporary livelihoods, socio-ecological systems, and the dilemmas we all face in natural resource use and sustainability. Regarding the first goal, students are introduced to the natural science of conservation biology and community ecology, along with influential concepts in the social science of decision-making and cultural institutions of resource management. We review key models of ecosystem dynamics and social interaction from evolutionary ecology, disturbance ecology, niche construction, common property theory, and political ecology to approach questions about consumption, complex socio-ecological systems, and the role of humans in food webs and trophic interactions. The course then investigates archaeological and paleo-ecological evidence concerning the evolution of human subsistence systems, global settlement, intensification, and their implications for understanding environmental change over the last two million years. We take the broadest possible anthropological approach: we explore the diversity of ways that humans have made a living in the past, and investigate a wide variety of contemporary systems of resource use. We begin with the emergence of subsistence regimes among the earliest members of our genus and variability in environmental conditions through the Pleistocene. We then discuss the spread of modern humans and arguments concerning the ecological impact of people in the New Worlds as humans first colonized Australia, the Americas, and islands of Pacific and Indian Oceans. Finally, students investigate contemporary Indigenous systems of resource use and food production, exploring interactions between people and culturally constructed environments, commensal relationships between humans and non-human plants and animals, processes of intensification, and ecosystem function.

It follows the genre's evolution into the twenty-first century, outlining the relationships among the texts that form the body of African American narrative as well as the relationships of those texts to the constantly shifting cultural and political realities surrounding their writing. From the Renaissance heralded by Alain Locke, through the Civil Rights and Black Power Movements -and their attendant Black Arts Movement- and into the era of the Movement for Black Lives, course readings encompass a broad range of styles and genres, from realism, naturalism, and naturalist primitivism, through the experimental forms, magical realism, and ""postrace aesthetics"" of later times. The course invites students to think critically about the African American novel as a socially and politically engaged form, and to identify and analyze the long tradition of resistance that variously informs its development. Authors covered in the course might include major figures such as Claude McKay, Zora Neale Hurston, Nella Larsen, Wallace Thurman, Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, Ann Petry, James Baldwin, Ishmael Reed, Earnest Gaines, Alice Walker, Toni Morrison, Toni Cade Bambara, Octavia Butler, Gayle Jones, Samuel Delany, Charles Johnson, John Edgar Wideman, Colson Whitehead, and others. Still, the course gives due attention to lesser known/studied materials from the period, including graphic novels, satire, speculative fiction, performance novels, and various other experimental forms. Course readings and instruction give particular attention to how African American novels of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries variously engage social identity categories, like race, gender, class, and sexuality, and how they engage and resist various literary conventions associated with naturalism, modernism, and postmodernism. The course also traces the development of new thematic and aesthetic interests in a generation of writers whose fiction has been influenced by the explosion of interest in the graphic novel, the popularity of cultural forms such as hip hop, and the ascendancy of the digital age. Scholarly readings accompany primary texts to give students a sense of the critical work that has gone into and continues to go on in the study of African American literature.
