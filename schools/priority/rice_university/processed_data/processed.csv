ANTH 373 - APPLIED ARCHAEOLOGY,"Description: Through this seminar, students learn about applied professions archaeology, specifically cultural resource management and related work in heritage, preservation, education and outreach. It focuses on the realm of cultural resource management, an interdisciplinary professional field whose practitioners utilize a combination of historical, architectural, and archaeological investigations in compliance with federal, state, and local regulations. Students will learn about the history and evolution of cultural resource management and legislation relating to archaeological resources in the U.S. from the late 19th century onwards, as well as how professionals identify, assess, and at times mitigate or preserve cultural resources. This work often takes place at the front lines of negotiation between the past and the present as the U.S. government, local communities, and private entities carefully balance a concern for the preservation of cultural resources alongside the growing need for construction, maintenance, and development projects. Thus, this course focuses on legal, ethical, and community mandates for the management of heritage sites, objects, landscapes and intangible heritage. Graduate/Undergraduate Equivalency: ANTH 573 .
