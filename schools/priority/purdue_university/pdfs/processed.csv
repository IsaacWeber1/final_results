This course is designed to help participants learn to effectively manage self, peers, teams, clients, and firms in diverse organizational settings and to lead organizational change to foster inclusion, equality, and productive workplaces. The class is designed to develop your skills in leading diversity and inclusion from a multi-level view in the workplace: employee, leader, team member, organizational, and institutional/societal levels. Its goal is to a) improve your ability to work in diverse teams, as well as b) develop your ability to design, and implement strategies to foster cultural and structural change to support the management of an increasingly diverse workforce toward enhanced organizational effectiveness to benefit business, employees, and society. People and leaders in organizations are constantly working with members of different backgrounds, social identities, and experiences, often across distributed and/or digitally connected environments, fostering increased attention to diversity equity and inclusion in transforming employment settings. When understood, supported and leveraged effectively, these differences in social identities, difference and values can help attract and retain talent, strengthen societal and community economic equality, support organizational and team effectiveness; but when overlooked, or mismanaged, these differences can increase turnover, conflict, stress, talent under-utilization, and harm career and work-life wellbeing, health, and productivity. We will focus on advancing understanding of how intersecting organizational and institutional structures and cultures and their relation to strategies for creating diversity; an inclusive culture and positive climate for inclusion and talent management; and developing and retaining diverse talent to foster innovation and organizational effectiveness across multiple levels of intervention. We discuss how to conduct an organizational diagnosis of the current diversity climate and barriers and facilitators for creating a multicultural workplace and a flexible environment supportive of many identities, and how assumptions of ""ideal workers"" may vary across industry and cultural contexts. You as a leader will be better able to articulate your own DEI vision and develop understanding of strategies that move from description to evidence-based diagnosis to action strategies and implementation in order to move aspirations into organizational change realities. From an individual leadership perspective, we tackle the question: ""Why does diversity, equity and inclusion matter in employing organizations and business, what is the state- of-the-art evidence-based knowledge, and what does it mean to me personally in my career and my leadership beliefs?"" Specifically, we focus on the business and social science processes - including attitudes toward in-groups and out-groups, stereotyping, identity, privilege, and power, intersectionality, discrimination, bias, influence opportunity, bystander awareness, allyship, difficult conversations, and perspective taking - these topics relate to how members of different social groups perceive and interact with one another. Since managing social identity increasingly involves managing work-life boundaries and work and non-work public and private selves, we will also learn about authenticity choices and social and public/professional identity boundary management. Further, the opportunity to experience higher well-being and work-life balance is increasingly linked to job and life opportunities reflecting growing work-life inequality in society. From an organizational and group perspective, we address the questions: ""What are best practices for successful management of diversity and inclusion? And why does it matter to me as a future leader personally and in business and in the communities and world in which I live."" Credits: 2.00 or 3.00 MGMT 56100 - Logistics Credit Hours: 2.00 or 3.00.
