Materials are at the foundation for all of engineering, as evident by the latest products that we design, to the airplanes that we fly, to the latest smartphones. In fact, breakthroughs with material research are often accompanied by rapid advancements in technology. Thus, it is paramount for all engineers to have an understanding of the structure and behavior of materials. In this class, we focus on the structure of materials, the microstructure connection to mechanical properties, and, ultimately, failure mechanisms. Materials play an important role in both design and manufacturing, which will be addressed in the context of components and extreme environments. Of specific interest will be defects within materials, defect formation/evolution, and their role in strengthening mechanisms.

        "Description": "The usage of materials is the backbone of engineering practice. Yet, advances in materials have stagnated due to overly conservative approaches, trial-and-error testing, and long qualification times. Material modeling offers tremendous opportunities to address these issues. This class offers advanced modeling strategies at the intersection of mechanics and materials science for both polycrystalline and composite materials. The course topics are defined as follows: First, advanced micromechanics analysis of modern engineering materials with emphasis on relating elastic microstructural phenomena to the mechanics of material behavior, via the Eshelby inclusion problem and its application to fiber reinforced composites. Second, classical plasticity is summarized via phenomenological and mathematical formulation of the constitutive laws, including yielding, yield surface; von Mises, Tresca yield criteria; Drucker's stability postulate; strain or work hardening, normality rule, perfect plasticity, and stress-strain law. Third, crystal plasticity is discussed, specifically physical and mathematical foundation for plasticity in crystalline materials, with a detailed description of the Bishop and Hill implementation of the Taylor model for deformation of polycrystals. Lastly, concepts of dislocations leading to strengthening mechanisms in metals are discussed: (i) by studying the anisotropy of material and elastoplastic properties at crystal level, microstructural basis for deformation in metals, polymers, and ceramics and (ii) failure mechanisms and toughening in metals, with primary emphasis on work/strain hardening, solid solution hardening, precipitate hardening, and grain boundaries. The course will be comprised of three projects, where the student chooses the topic of the third and final project. Prerequisite: AAE 55300 or equivalent."

        "Description": "Intended for science and engineering majors. Basic physics and math knowledge will be assumed. The picture of how the Universe came to be and how it has evolved has recently come into sharp focus. This progress is the result of improved observational techniques that have resulted in high resolution images of very distant galaxies, a more accurate mapping of the Large Scale Structure of the Universe or the high resolution picture of the young universe provided by Cosmic Microwave Background observations. We will present a historical perspective of how ideas and data have shaped Cosmology through the centuries. In addition, we will review the theoretical models that are in agreement with the current observations. Our goal will be to provide the students with a broad overview of the current research in Cosmology with an eye toward stimulating the students curiosity about the many questions still awaiting answers in this field."

        "Description": "We are what we eat! The food we put into our bodies not only gives us the nutrients, vitamins and minerals we need to live, but it can also influence other ways in which our bodies function, right down to how well our immune system works. The immune system plays a critical role in defending our body from infection, but can also contribute to autoimmune disease when the immune response becomes dysregulated. Importantly, autoimmune disease is currently skyrocketing in countries that consume a \"Western Diet\" (i.e., high salt, high sugar, low fiber), suggesting that these dietary components, or lack thereof, may contribute to dysregulation of the immune response. CD4+ T cells, a kind of immune cell, play an important role in the immune system as they control the balance between protective immunity and autoimmune disease. Recent evidence indicates a strong correlation between \"Western Diet\" and dysfunction of this important immune cell type. Therefore, our goal is to examine the effects of these dietary components on CD4+ T cell function and how this might contribute to autoimmune disease. Students will work in teams and cover a distinct subset of microbial or dietary components. As such, each student will learn the necessary skills to perform scientific experiments starting from the literature search, experimental design, carrying out controlled experiments, interpreting results and conveying the results to the greater scientific community."

        "Description": "The course will revolve around genomics, the science and technology involved in determining the sequence of the entire DNA complement in an organism. Almost everyone has heard of the human genome project, but fewer are aware of the spectacular technical progress in this field and the fact that many thousands of genomes have been sequenced. Until recently, most of these have been microorganisms, but technological and computational progress has made it progressively easier and cheaper to sequence the genomes of higher organisms. This field may have more of an impact on your future lives than almost any other field of the life sciences - mostly because it touches on all areas of study. The course will focus on the impact that genomes will have in selected areas. It will begin with a basic understanding of the science and technology that gave rise to our current capabilities in sequencing and the fact that technology continues to provide greater capacity and cheaper prices. You will soon see that every field in the College of Science is well represented in the science and technology. We will then go on to see how genomics influences many topics that affect our daily lives and can possibly provide answers to some critical questions (or at least pose better questions): What is the basis of personalized medicine? What does genomics tell us about the genealogy of mankind? What impact will genomics have on our future food supply and our ability to feed a population of 9 billion people? What is the human microbiome and what does that mean to me? Similarly, what is the gut microbiome, the mouth microbiome, etc? What impact will genomics have on the development of alternative energy sources, especially biofuels? In every area, we will discuss the scientific challenges, but also the ethical and societal implications. In most cases, there is no one right answer, but a series of choices that can be guided by ethical considerations."

The course involves the application of several fundamental chemical engineering principles, including those related to mass transfer, separations, and fluid flow, to devices used for extracorporeal therapies and other treatments. The first part of the course addresses the relevant physiology and pathophysiology serving as a foundation for subsequent clinical material. With the focus on extracorporeal devices, the interactions between blood and biomaterials in a general sense are also explored. The second part of the course assesses the extracorporeal treatment of kidney failure by dialysis, which is highlighted as the only long-term, device-based replacement therapy for terminal organ failure (end-stage renal disease). This analysis will not only consider the evolution of dialysis therapy from a technology perspective but also the forces that have shaped its development into a market generating annual revenue of nearly $100 billion on a global basis. In addition, extracorporeal support therapies used clinically not only for failure of other organs (namely the heart, liver, and lungs) but also systemic inflammation secondary to severe infection (sepsis) will be presented. The third segment of the course addresses industry-focused concepts pertaining to medical device development, including verification/validation, lean manufacturing, project management, and regulatory issues. Providing a real-world perspective based on broad experience in the medical device field, Ms. Michelle Chutka (see below) will lead this third part of the course. Permission of instructor required."

The course focuses on the principles, tools, and procedures used in the design-build project delivery method. It provides students with sufficient education to become certified (following additional examination) by the Design Build Institute of America as an Associate Member and dependent on employment experience, a full Member. Traditional project delivery methods, Design-Bid-Build, Construction Manager as Agent, 'Fast Track', and other 'rip and read' methods are losing popularity to project delivery methods that take a more collaborative approach. Collaboration requires a different way of thinking about a capital construction project and working with others in project delivery. Constructors must move from a transactional, arms- length relationship where the project is viewed as a low-price commodity to a full-suite delivery of services resulting in a high- value product. This requires collaboration with the Owner and other members of the project delivery process, something that has been missing from traditional project delivery methods. Active student participation is required. Student participation will be facilitated through assigned presentations, in-class projects, field trips to local projects, and guest lectures. Students who complete the course and achieve DBIA's minimum requirements (Fundamentals of Project Delivery, Principles of Design- Building Project Delivery, Post Award, and Contracts & Risk Management) will be eligible for recognition by DBIA.

We will investigate how art has been used as a tool to transform cultural perspectives, alter policies, and promote social change. We will explore a range of artists whose methodologies, materials and approach challenge the cultural norms. From printmakers to musicians, to choreographers, to performance artists, students will engage and evaluate the act of art-making as a tactic of resistance and the responses to those acts. We will investigate readings that argue for and against the need for artists to make work that politically challenge their society. Once a foundation of knowledge has been laid, we will turn to the creative process through an investigation of materials and practices -performance, mixed media, and photography. Students will research, watch, discuss, create, and perform their own projects that promote social transformation."

Economics is a broad and diverse body of ideas that helps us understand those everyday choices and the kinds of outcomes they generate. We will explore these economic ideas and the ways that institutions affect outcomes, from informal social norms all the way to big questions of social organization such as the contrast between capitalism and socialism. Our main method of exploring economic ideas will be communicating those ideas - through writing, video, and other multimedia approaches; we will build and deepen our understanding of economic ideas in society by explaining them, applying them, and sharing them with others.

Why nations are poor and how they can become rich is one of the most important questions in Economics. We will look at the role of investment, schooling, population growth and technology. Part two: we explore how globalization affects productivity and innovation. This includes how international trade and domestic policies affect allocative efficiency, accelerate structural change, and discipline competitive behaviors by domestic firms. We explore how firms grow on global markets, how technology is embodied in traded inputs, and how international markets for ideas and the possibility of imitation can lead to explosive growth. Part three: we explore a rapidly growing literature on the economics of innovation. We'll wrestle with the questions of: where new ideas come from, and whether it is becoming more difficult to innovate; how cities become hotbeds of innovation and how this will be affected by remote work; and how innovation can be shaped by choices of firms and by government policies."

Examples of such are the computers on your car's engine that control fuel injection, fly-by-wire attitude controls in modern jet aircraft, even the microcontroller inside a cellular phone. In these examples, the computer has a specific, limited task that is part of the functionality of the device and specifying average performance of that computer is insufficient for successful completion of the task at hand. Imagine if the flight controls of a Boeing 787 on final landing approach experienced a \"network lag\" similar to that which occurs occasionally while you're reading e-mail.

Reflective practice is the capacity to reflect on action to engage in a process of continuous learning. Reflective practice can be an important tool in practice-based professional learning settings where people learn from their own professional experiences, rather than from formal learning or knowledge transfer. It may be the most important source of personal professional development and improvement. It is also an important way to bring together theory and practice. A person who reflects throughout their practice is not just looking back on past actions and events, but is taking a conscious look at emotions, experiences, actions, and responses, and using that information to add to their existing knowledge base and reach a higher level of understanding. Critical reflection as part of experiential education generates, deepens, and documents learning. As a result of this course, you will be able to articulate the value of your experiential education opportunities toward marketing yourself for potential job opportunities and develop the skills needed to become a reflective practitioner for promotional growth in your future career.

Important strategic questions arise from such a radical shift in marketing mix options, questions such as: How to allocate resources to customer acquisition and to customer retention? Are loyal customers more profitable for firms? Related to these strategic questions are important conceptual and computational issues, such as: What metrics are best used to measure customer profitability? What techniques can be used to identify most profitable customers? How to target profitable customers with customized price, promotion, product, place? This course will equip you with the skills and tools you need to answer such strategic, conceptual and computational questions related to customer relationship management (CRM). Permission of instructor required."

        "Description": "Consumer behavior is the study of the processes involved when individuals or groups select, purchase, use, or dispose of products, services, ideas, or experiences to satisfy needs and desires. We will draw on research from psychology, marketing, behavior economics and other fields to learn why consumers behave in the ways that they do. The course focuses on three general topics: 1) Consumers as individuals. We will explore basic psychological concepts like intrinsic motivation, perception, memory, and emotions to help us understand behavior. 2) Attitude change and decision making. We will examine how consumers search and evaluate alternatives, develop attitudes, and make choices. 3) Consumers in their social and cultural settings. We will examine the interaction between the consumer and multiple external influences. We investigate how social elements (friends, family, etc.) and culture influence behavior. Consumer behavior is an applied discipline rooted in other social sciences, and you will therefore learn multiple concepts, frameworks and theories. Your job is to master those concepts and use them to organize, explain, and predict consumers' judgments and choices. Ultimately you should be able to identify a consumer behavior issue, select a relevant theory to examine and explain the issue, and apply the theory properly to aid in a managerial decision. You will also learn how to run basic applied experiments in consumer behavior to test your theories with real consumers."

This course is designed to help participants learn to effectively manage self, peers, teams, clients, and\nfirms in diverse organizational settings and to lead organizational change to foster inclusion, equality, and productive workplaces.\nThe class is designed to develop your skills in leading diversity and inclusion from a multi-level view in the workplace:\nemployee, leader, team member, organizational, and institutional/societal levels. Its goal is to a) improve your ability to work in\ndiverse teams, as well as b) develop your ability to design, and implement strategies to foster cultural and structural change to\nsupport the management of an increasingly diverse workforce toward enhanced organizational effectiveness to benefit business,\nemployees, and society. People and leaders in organizations are constantly working with members of different backgrounds,\nsocial identities, and experiences, often across distributed and/or digitally connected environments, fostering increased attention\nto diversity equity and inclusion in transforming employment settings. When understood, supported and leveraged effectively,\nthese differences in social identities, difference and values can help attract and retain talent, strengthen societal and community\neconomic equality, support organizational and team effectiveness; but when overlooked, or mismanaged, these differences can\nincrease turnover, conflict, stress, talent under-utilization, and harm career and work-life wellbeing, health, and productivity. We\nwill focus on advancing understanding of how intersecting organizational and institutional structures and cultures and their\nrelation to strategies for creating diversity; an inclusive culture and positive climate for inclusion and talent management; and\ndeveloping and retaining diverse talent to foster innovation and organizational effectiveness across multiple levels of\nintervention. We discuss how to conduct an organizational diagnosis of the current diversity climate and barriers and facilitators\nfor creating a multicultural workplace and a flexible environment supportive of many identities, and how assumptions of \"ideal\nworkers\" may vary across industry and cultural contexts. You as a leader will be better able to articulate your own DEI vision and\ndevelop understanding of strategies that move from description to evidence-based diagnosis to action strategies and\nimplementation in order to move aspirations into organizational change realities. From an individual leadership perspective, we\ntackle the question: \"Why does diversity, equity and inclusion matter in employing organizations and business, what is the state-\nof-the-art evidence-based knowledge, and what does it mean to me personally in my career and my leadership beliefs?\"\nSpecifically, we focus on the business and social science processes - including attitudes toward in-groups and out-groups,\nstereotyping, identity, privilege, and power, intersectionality, discrimination, bias, influence opportunity, bystander awareness,\nallyship, difficult conversations, and perspective taking - these topics relate to how members of different social groups perceive\nand interact with one another. Since managing social identity increasingly involves managing work-life boundaries and work and\nnon-work public and private selves, we will also learn about authenticity choices and social and public/professional identity\nboundary management. Further, the opportunity to experience higher well-being and work-life balance is increasingly linked to\njob and life opportunities reflecting growing work-life inequality in society. From an organizational and group perspective, we\naddress the questions: \"What are best practices for successful management of diversity and inclusion?

        "Description": "As applications of data science permeate more aspects of our lives, new and important ethical issues are arising. However, especially because we are entering uncharted territory, reasoning clearly about the ethical implications of data science isn't easy. This course provides students with the tools for doing so, including a conceptual framework for ethical reasoning in professional settings, as well as a procedure for case-study analysis that allows students to practice employing this conceptual framework. Together, these components help prepare students to be ethical professionals and responsible global citizens."

What is the nature of consciousness and subjective experience? Could other animals, aliens, computers, robots or other types of entities have minds, or be conscious? How would we know?

What are the human and environmental costs of a full-throated adoption of AI? This class will arm you with the philosophical and historical background to begin to devise and weigh the creative opportunities and challenges posed by this future. We'll first consider traditional questions and issues in the philosophy of computation, epistemology, ethics and justice before turning to home onto a series of specific challenges that may include issues of AI in equity, AI and the law, AI and gender, AI and labor, AI and policy, the future of AI, and whether we can even design 'ethical' AI."

        "Description": "Repeatable twice for a maximum of 9 credits. Academic philosophy demands both the ability to read large amounts of texts fluently, carefully, and closely. Furthermore, the abstract nature of philosophical discourse places a large cognitive demand upon readers. This course prepares non-native English speakers philosophy students for these intensive reading demands. The course has three major learning areas: the language skills that students need to read fluently (i.e., the efficient processing of language for general comprehension of meaning); reading strategies that students can use to improve comprehension and learning; and communication about readings, as the close reading of texts is essential to communicating one's ideas both orally and in writing. Students are also supported in their regular philosophy courses. This course is linked to one or more 500+ level philosophy seminars that students in this course are enrolled in. Reading materials, writing activities, and projects for the course are designed to complement tasks and projects required in the linked philosophy seminar. Permission of department required."

We will begin with issues of definition, and theoretical and empirical approaches to the study of terrorism. We will then delve into the history and evolution of the tactic (taking time to study some of the more notorious organizations). At this point in time it is critical that we look at both domestic-particularly in the United States-and transnational forms of terrorism. The study of terrorism is rife with puzzles that we will explore. Why resort to violence in the first place? How and why do groups evolve over time? How and why do some groups end, and others continue for years? Why are some individuals/groups not classified as terrorists? What are the consequences of terrorism? We will also look closely at counterterrorism policy. What are the most effective ways to respond to terrorism? What doesn't work? How do policies differ between states? To what extent is there global cooperation on counterterrorism? We will conclude the class by taking a critical look at US counterterrorism policy and the massive counterterrorism apparatus that has developed in the aftermath of the attacks of September 11, 2001. Should counterterrorism dominate US national security priorities to the degree it does?"

The view taken in this course is that to understand current processes of globalization we need to examine it in less broad and amorphous ways by focusing on its specific manifestations. Thus, this course focuses on how China has managed the challenges of globalization. China is a particularly useful case study because it failed the challenges of globalization in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. For an ancient civilization such as China, this failure had tremendous impact on its national pride. The Chinese refer to this historical juncture as the \"century of shame.\" Towards the end of the 20th century and the onset of the 21st, China faced again the challenges of globalization and has arisen to the tasks in a spectacular fashion, transforming a largely rural and agriculture economy into the world's second largest economic power. This amazing transformation is leading some to proclaim that the 21st century will belong to China!"

Is it possible to identify distinct neurophysiological markers of your awareness of a particular sight, sound, taste, or touch? What is the cortical basis of your sense of being a self with a first-person point of view that is spatiotemporally grounded in a body? How does consciousness relate to attention and working memory? Does consciousness have an adaptive function? Might a person in a coma or a vegetative state still have some form of awareness? Could a computer or a robot ever have what we would consider to be genuine experiences? During the past few decades, these and other questions about the nature of consciousness have been the focus of increasing empirical and theoretical research in neuroscience and other disciplines. The main purpose of the course is to introduce students to this exciting field of inquiry by exposing them to a variety of representative books and articles in the literature. The \"backbone\" of the course will be Stanislas Dehaene's Consciousness and the brain: Deciphering how the brain codes our thoughts (2014). As we go through the course, we will use each successive chapter in this book as the starting point for a deeper and wider exploration of the given topic(s), bringing into our discussion relevant experimental findings and philosophical perspectives from other investigators.

        "Description": "This course examines how genes regulate development and function of the brain to ultimately influence behavior. Genetics has come to be an important aspect of research in almost every field of Neuroscience and Psychology ranging from neural development to cognitive function and dysfunction. However, many students have not had the opportunity to explore this in their studies to date. Therefore, the goal of this course is to provide students with the background needed to understand and think critically about the genetic components of Neuroscience and behavioral research. Numerous questions will be explored mainly through discussion of research papers. Lectures by the professor will fill in background knowledge needed to understand the readings. The questions explored will include: What are chromosomes and genes? What do they do? How do they do it? How do genes control development of the brain? How are single genes manipulated in animals to study their effects on behavior? How can genes associated with normal or abnormal behavior be identified? What has been learned from gene-behavior studies in animals? in humans? What do these studies tell us about the nature-nurture controversy? In addition to exploring these more traditional aspects of behavioral genetics we will address the three most exciting recent developments. These include the use of transgenic primate models, selective remote control of specific neural circuits using optogenetics and chemogenetics, and epigenetics, which helps explain how environmental factors and behavior itself can change gene activity and how these changes may be transmitted from one generation to the next. Many behaviors could be used to explore the principles these questions address. The readings will be selected from papers that focus on learning & memory and mental illness. However, if students are interested in other behaviors, papers that involve those behaviors and serve our purposes can be substituted. Grading will be based mainly on informal presentations of papers and participation in discussions of these papers. Permission of department required."

How have some developing countries become more developed than others? What roles do corporations, the state, and civil society organizations play in the processes of global development? How is global development interrelated with the physical environment, inequalities of consumption, and the environmental crisis? How do people resist the inequalities and perceived injustices of global development through global social movements?

The study of culture centrally concerns the place of meaning in human life, and we will explore how television shapes and is shaped by culture. We will consider how signs, symbols, language, conceptual structures, forms of knowledge, and forms of power interact to create meaning in our life. Cultural change both produces and is produced by changes in meaning, and we will investigate how cultural change occurs, with a focus on topics like changes to American cultures of love, work, religion, and politics."

        "Description": "(FNR 31300) (HORT 31100) There has been significant renewed interest in the investigation of integrated fish-food plant systems. Such systems have a long and rich history, particularly in Asia, and our impending food crisis has kindled an interest in developing aquaponic systems in western countries. Many growers are turning to controlled environment and hydroponic production methods to produce high-value crops in tight quarters. High input costs can, however, be a limitation. The waste disposal problem of the fish can become the nutrient supply to the plants."
