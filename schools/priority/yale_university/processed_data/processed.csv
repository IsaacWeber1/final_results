"* NELC 0090a / HUMS 0245a, Six Global Perspectives on Evil: Murder, Law, and True Crime in History","Harem conspiracies, kings’ assassinations, self-defense killings, witch hunts, and serial murderers. The history of murder, violence, and criminal investigation is as old as humankind. In this course, we discuss how the way crime was perceived and punished has changed throughout history. From mythical accounts of murders, to real records of trials of humans, animals, and even objects accused of homicide or witchcraft, we analyze how aspects of social status or gender played a role in shaping punishment across Eastern and Western civilizations. We compare codified-law civilizations to those in which custom, social pressure, and community ethics determined correct behavior. Four historical cold cases with accompanying evidence are presented for in-class debate, and… perhaps students may be able to help solve an old mystery! At the end of the semester, we recreate historical trials using the same crime, evidence, and participants, but following the law and procedures of each one of the historical settings covered in this course. Will the verdict and sentence be any different? Friday sessions alternate between writing workshops and field trips to Yale collections. This course is part of the ""Six Pretty Good Ideas"" program. Enrollment limited to first-year students. WR , HU RP 1½ Course cr MW 11:35am-12:50pm",https://catalog.yale.edu/ycps/courses/nelc/,3.5,CCUS,production-3,"{""ccus"": 1}"

"* CENG 464a / ENVE 4640a, Engineering Solutions to Climate Change","Current industrial processes that supply essential materials and energy for modern society emit greenhouse gases that drive climate change. This course develops a framework based on mass and energy balances, thermodynamics of energy conversions and chemical reactions, catalytic surface reactions, and electrochemistry to evaluate current approaches for manufacturing chemicals and fuels and to engineer sustainable alternatives as climate change solutions. Topics include contributions of the chemical industry and fuels to climate change, renewable energy transition, survey of major chemical manufacturing processes, CO2 storage and utilization, resilient processes, and other emerging chemical manufacturing and energy storage solutions to mitigate climate change. The course involves a semester-long original analysis project. This course applies chemical and physical concepts and methods used in other science and engineering courses.
